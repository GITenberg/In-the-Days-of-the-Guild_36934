<h2>I<br />
<br />
THE BOY WITH THE WOOLPACK<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW ROBERT EDRUPT JOURNEYED WITH THE WOOL-MERCHANTS
TO LONDON</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the reign of King Henry&nbsp;II., when as yet there were no
factories, no railways or even coaches, no post-offices and
no tea-tables in England, a boy sat on a hillside not far
from Salisbury Plain, with a great bale of wool by his side.
It was not wrapped in paper; it was packed close and very skillfully
bound together with cords, lengthwise and crosswise,
making a network of packthread all over it. The boy&rsquo;s name
was Robert Edrupt, but in the tiny village where he was born
he had always been called Hob. He had been reared by his
grandfather, a shepherd, and now the old shepherd was dead
and he was going to seek his fortune.</p>

<p>The old grandmother, Dame Lysbeth, was still alive, but
there was not much left for her to live on. She had a few
sheep and a little garden, chickens, a beehive, and one field;
and she and her grandson had decided that he should take the
wool, which was just ready for market when the sudden death
of the shepherd took place, and ask the dealers when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
came by if they would not take him with them to London.
Now he was waiting, as near the road as he could get, listening
hard for the tinkle of their horse-bells around the shoulder
of the down.</p>

<p>The road would not really be called a road to-day. It was
a track, trodden out about half way up the slope of the
valley in some parts of it, and now and then running along
the top of the long, low hills that have been called downs
as long as the memory of man holds a trace of them. Sometimes
it would make a sharp twist to cross the shallows of a
stream, for there were scarcely any bridges in the country. In
some places it was wide enough for a regiment, and but faintly
marked; in others it was bitten deep into the hillside and so
narrow that three men could hardly have gone abreast upon it.
But it did not need to be anything more than a trail, or bridle-path,
because no wagons went that way,&mdash;only travelers afoot
or a-horseback. At some seasons there would be wayfarers all
along the road from early in the morning until sunset, and
they would even be found camping by the wayside; at other
times of the year one might walk for hours upon it and meet
nobody at all. Robert had been sitting where he was for about
three hours; and he had walked between four and five miles,
woolpack on shoulder, before he reached the road; he had risen
before the sun did that morning. Now he began to wonder if
the wool-merchants had already gone by. It was late in the
season, and if they had, there was hardly any hope of sending
the wool to market that year.</p>

<p>But worry never worked aught, as the saying is, and people
who take care of sheep seem to worry less than others; there
are many things that they cannot change, and they are kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
busy attending to their flocks. Robert, who did not intend to
be called Hob any more, took from his pouch some coarse
bread and cheese and began munching it, for by the sun it
was the dinner-hour&mdash;nine o&rsquo;clock. Meanwhile he made sure
that the silver penny in the corner of the pouch, which hung
at his girdle and served him for a pocket, was safe. It was.
It was about the size of a modern halfpenny and had a cross
on one side. A penny such as this could be cut in quarters,
and each piece passed as a coin.</p>

<p>Just as the last bit of bread and cheese vanished there came,
from far away over the fern, the jingle-jink-jing of strings of
bells on the necks of pack-horses. A few minutes later the
shaggy head and neck of the leader came in sight. They were
strong, not very big horses; and while they were not built for
racing, they were quick walkers. They could travel over
rough country at a very good pace, even when, as they now
were, loaded heavily with packs of wool. Robert stood up,
his heart beating fast: he had never seen them so close before.
The merchants were laughing and talking and seemed to be
in a good humor, and he hoped very much that they would
speak to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said the one who rode nearest to him, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s another,
as I live. Did you grow out of the ground, and have
you roots like the rest of them, bumpkin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert bowed; he was rather angry, but this was no time
to answer back. &ldquo;I have wool to sell, so please you,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;if you be in need of a horse-boy, I would
work my passage to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who had spoken frowned and pulled at his beard,
but the leader, who had been talking to some one behind him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
now turned his face toward Robert. He was a kindly-looking,
ruddy-cheeked old fellow, with eyes as sharp as the stars on
a winter night that is clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; he said genially. &ldquo;Who are you, and why are you
so fond to go to London, young sheep-dog?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert told his story, as short and straight as he could, for
he could see that some of the merchants were impatient. This
was only one pack of wool, and at the next market-town they
would probably find enough to load all the rest of their train
of horses, when they could push straight on to London and
get their money. &ldquo;If you desire to know further of what I
say,&rdquo; the boy ended his speech, &ldquo;the landlord of the Woolpack
will tell you that our fleeces are as fine and as heavy as
any in the market, so please you, master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; the wool-merchant said again. &ldquo;Give him one of
the spare nags, Gib, and take up the pack, lad, for we must be
getting on. What if I find thee a liar and send thee back
from the inn, hey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I be a liar, I will go,&rdquo; said Robert joyfully, and he
climbed on the great horse, and the whole company went
trotting briskly onward.</p>

<p>Robert found in course of time, however, that when we
have got what we want, it is not always what we like most
heartily. He had been on a horse before, but had never
ridden for any length of time, and riding all day long on the
hard-paced pack-horses over hill and valley was no play. Then,
when they reached the town, and the merchants began to
joke and trade with the shepherds who had brought in their
wool for market-day, and all the people of the inn were bustling
about getting supper, he had to help Gib and Jack, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
horse-boys, to rub down the horses, take off their packs, and
feed and water them. He nearly got into a terrible pickle
for not knowing that you must not water a horse that has been
traveling for hours until it has had at least half an hour to
rest and cool off. When he finally did get his supper, a bowl
of hot stew and some bread and cheese,&mdash;and extremely good
it tasted,&mdash;it was time for bed. He and the other serving-lads
had to sleep on the wool packs piled in the open courtyard
of the inn, which was built in a hollow square,&mdash;two-story
buildings and stables around the square court where the horses
and baggage were left. This did not trouble Robert, however.
He had slept on the open hillside more than once, and
it was a clear night; he could see Arthur&rsquo;s Wain shining among
the other stars, and hear the horses, not far away, contentedly
champing their grain.</p>

<p>The next morning he woke up lame and weary, but that
wore off after a time. Nobody in the company paid attention
to aching muscles; what was occupying the minds of the
traffickers was the fear of getting the wool to London too late
to secure their price for it. Italian and Flemish merchants
had their agents there, buying up the fleeces from the great
flocks of the abbeys, and Master Hardel had taken his company
further west than usual, this year. No stop would be
made after this, except to eat and sleep, for the horses were
now loaded with all that they could carry.</p>

<p>On the second night, it rained, and every one was wet,&mdash;not
as wet as might be supposed, however, considering that
no umbrellas and no rubber coats existed. Each man wore instead
of a hat a pointed hood, with a cape, the front turned
back from his eyes. By folding the cape around him he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
keep off the worst of the rain, for the cloth had a shaggy nap,
and was close-woven as well. On legs and feet were long
woolen hose which dried when the sun came out; and some
had leathern tunics under their cloaks.</p>

<p>It was rather jolly on the road, even in the rain. The dark-bearded
man, who was called Jeffrey, knew numberless tales
and songs, and when he could turn a jest on any of the party
he invariably did. No one took any especial notice of Robert,
except that the man called Gib shifted as much of his own
work on him as possible, and sometimes, when they were riding
in the rear, grumbled viciously about the hard riding and
small pay. There is usually one person of that sort in any
company of travelers.</p>

<p>Robert minded neither the hard work nor Gib&rsquo;s scolding.
He was as strong as a young pony, and he was seeing the world,
of which he had dreamed through many a long, thyme-scented
day on the Downs, with soft little noises of sheep cropping
turf all about him as he lay. What London would be like he
could not quite make out, for as yet he had seen no town of
more than a thousand people.</p>

<p>At last, near sunset, somebody riding ahead raised a shout
and flung up his arm, and all knew that they were within
sight of London&mdash;London, the greatest city in England, with
more than a hundred churches inside its towered city wall.
They pushed the horses hard, hoping to reach the New Gate
before eight o&rsquo;clock, but it was of no use. They were still
nearly a mile from the walls when the far sound of bells
warned them that they were too late. They turned back and
stayed their steps at an inn called the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, out
on the road to the west country over which the drovers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the packmen came. A long pole over the door had on its end
a bunch of green boughs and red berries&mdash;the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; told them
that ale was to be had within. The landlord was a West
Country man, and Robert found to his joy that the landlord&rsquo;s
old father had known Colin Edrupt the shepherd and Dame
Lysbeth, and danced at their wedding, nearly half a century
before.</p>

<p>Next morning, with the sun still in their eyes as they trotted
briskly Londonward, they came to the massive gray wall,
with the Fleet, a deep swift river, flowing down beside it
to the Thames. They were waiting outside New Gate when
the watchmen swung open the great doors, and the crowd of
travelers, traders and country folk began to push in. The men
with the woolpacks kept together, edging through the narrow
streets that sloped downward to the river where the tall ships
were anchored. The jingle of the bridle-bells, that rang so
loud and merrily over the hills, was quite drowned out in the
racket of the city streets where armorers were hammering,
horsemen crowding, tradesmen shouting, and business of every
sort was going on. Robert had somehow supposed that London
would be on a great level encircled by hills, but he found
with surprise that it was itself on a hill, crowned by the
mighty cathedral St. Paul&rsquo;s, longer than Winchester, with a
steeple that seemed climbing to pierce the clouds. At last
the shaggy laden horses came to a halt at a warehouse by the
river, where a little, dried-up-looking man in odd garments
looked the wool over and agreed with Master Hardel on the
price which he would pay. Robert could not understand a
word of the conversation, for the wholesale merchant was a
Hollander from Antwerp, and when he had loaded his ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
with the wool it would go to Flanders to be made into fine
cloth. Robert was so busy watching the transactions that
when the master spoke to him it made him jump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the money for thy wool, my lad,&rdquo; the old man
said kindly. &ldquo;Hark &rsquo;ee, if you choose to ride with us again,
meet me at Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush on the sixth day hence, and you
shall have that good-for-naught Gib&rsquo;s place. And keep thy
money safe; this is a place of thieves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was how Robert Edrupt rode from the West Country
and settled in his mind that some day he would himself be a
wool-merchant.</p>

<h2>II<br />
<br />
BASIL THE SCRIBE<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW AN IRISH MONK IN AN ENGLISH ABBEY CAME TO STAND
BEFORE KINGS</span></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Brother Basil</span>, of the scriptorium, was doing two
things at once with the same brain. He did not know
whether any of the other monks ever indulged in this
or not. None of them showed any signs of it.</p>

<p>The Abbot was clearly intent, soul, brain and body, on the
ruling of the community. In such a house as this dozens
of widely varied industries must be carried on, much time
spent in prayer, song and meditation, and strict attention
given to keeping in every detail the traditional Benedictine
rule. In many mediæval Abbeys not all these things were
done. Rumor hinted that one Order was too fond of ease,
and another of increasing its estates. In the Irish Abbey
where Brother Basil had received his first education, little
thought was given to anything but religion; the fare was of
the rudest and simplest kind. But in this English Abbey
everything in the way of clothing, tools, furniture, meat and
drink which could be produced on the lands was produced
there. Guests of high rank were often entertained. The
church, not yet complete, was planned on a magnificent scale.
The work of the making of books had grown into something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
like a large publishing business. As the parchments for the
writing, the leather for the covers, the goose-quill pens, the
metal clasps, the ink, and the colors for illuminated lettering,
were all made on the premises, a great deal of skilled labor
was involved. Besides the revenues from the sale of manuscript
volumes the Abbey sold increasing quantities of wool
each year. Under some Abbots this material wealth might
have led to luxury. But Benedict of Winchester held that a
man who took the vows of religion should keep them.</p>

<p>With this Brother Basil entirely agreed. He desired above
all to give his life to the service of God and the glory of
his Order. He was a skillful, accurate and rapid penman.
Manuscripts copied by him, or under his direction, had no
mistakes or slovenly carelessness about them. The pens which
he cut were works of art. The ink was from a rule for
which he had made many experiments. Every book was
carefully and strongly bound. Brother Basil, in short, was
an artist, and though the work might be mechanical, he
could not endure not to have it beautifully done.</p>

<p>The Abbot was quite aware of this, and made use of the
young monk&rsquo;s talent for perfection by putting him in charge
of the scriptorium. In the twelfth century the monks were
almost the only persons who had leisure for bookmaking.
They wrote and translated many histories; they copied the
books which made up their own libraries, borrowed books
wherever they could and copied those, over and over again.
They sold their work to kings, noblemen, and scholars, and
to other religious houses. The need for books was so great
that in the scriptorium of which Brother Basil had charge,
very little time was spent on illumination. Missals, chronicles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and books of hymns fancifully decorated in color were
done only when there was a demand for them. They were
costly in time, labor and material.</p>

<p>Brother Basil could copy a manuscript with his right hand
and one half his brain, while the other half dreamed of
things far afield. He could not remain blind to the grace
of a bird&rsquo;s wing on its flight northward in spring, to the delicate
seeking tendrils of grapevines, the starry beauty of daisies
or the tracery of arched leafless boughs. Within his mind
he could follow the gracious curves of the noble Norman
choir, and he had visions of color more lustrous than a sunrise.</p>

<p>Day by day, year by year, the sheep nibbled the tender
springing grass. Yet the green sward continued to be decked
with orfrey-work of many hues&mdash;buttercups, violets, rose-campion,
speedwell, daisies&mdash;defiant little bright heads not
three inches from the roots. His fancies would come up in
spite of everything, like the flowers.</p>

<p>But would it always be so? Was he to spend his life in
copying these bulky volumes of theology and history&mdash;the
same old phrases, the same authors, the same seat by the same
window? And some day, would he find that his dreams
had vanished forever? Might he not grow to be like Brother
Peter, who had kept the porter&rsquo;s lodge for forty years and
hated to see a new face? This was the doubt in the back
of his mind, and it was very sobering indeed.</p>

<p>Years ago, when he was a boy, he had read the old stories
of the missionary monks of Scotland and Ireland. These
men carried the message of the Cross to savage tribes, they
stood before Kings, they wrought wonders. Was there no
more need for such work as theirs? Even now there was fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
misrule in Ireland. Even now the dispute between church
and state had resulted in the murder of the Archbishop of
Canterbury on the steps of the altar. The Abbeys of all
England had hummed like bee-hives when that news came.</p>

<p>Brother Basil discovered just then that the ink was failing,
and went to see how the new supply was coming on. It was
a tedious task to make ink, but when made it lasted. Wood
of thorn-trees must be cut in April or May before the leaves
or flowers were out, and the bundles of twigs dried for two,
three or four weeks. Then they were beaten with wooden
mallets upon hard wooden tablets to remove the bark, which
was put in a barrel of water and left to stand for eight days.
The water was then put in a cauldron and boiled with some
of the bark, to boil out what sap remained. When it was
boiled down to about a third of the original measure it was
put into another kettle and cooked until black and thick,
and reduced again to a third of its bulk. Then a little pure
wine was added and it was further cooked until a sort of
scum showed itself, when the pot was removed from the fire
and placed in the sun until the black ink purified itself of
the dregs. The pure ink was then poured into bags of parchment
carefully sewn and hung in the sunlight until dry, when
it could be kept for any length of time till wanted. To
write, one moistened the ink with a little wine and vitriol.</p>

<p>As all the colors for illumination must be made by similar
tedious processes, it can be seen that unless there was a demand
for such work it would not be thrifty to do it.</p>

<p>Brother Basil arrived just in time to caution the lay brother,
Simon Gastard, against undue haste. Gastard was a clever
fellow, but he needed watching. He was too apt to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that a little slackness here and there was good for profits.
Brother Basil stood over him until the ink was quite up to
the standard of the Abbey. But his mind meanwhile ran on
the petty squabblings and dry records of the chronicle that he
had just been copying. How, after all, was he better than
Gastard? He was giving the market what it wanted&mdash;and
the book was not worth reading. If men were to write
chronicles, why not make them vivid as legends, true, stirring,
magnificent stories of the men who moved the world? Who
would care, in a thousand years, what rent was paid by the
tenant farmers of the Abbey, or who received a certain benefice
from the King?</p>

<p>As he turned from the sunlit court where the ink was a-making,
he received a summons to the Abbot&rsquo;s own parlor.
He found that dignitary occupied with a stout and consequential
monk of perhaps forty-five, who was looking bewildered,
snubbed, and indignant. Brother Ambrosius was most unaccustomed
to admonitions, even of the mildest. He had a wide
reputation as a writer, and was indeed the author of the very
volume which Brother Basil was now copying. He seemed
to know by instinct what would please the buyers of chronicles,
and especially what was to be left out.</p>

<p>It was also most unusual to see the Abbot thoroughly
aroused. He had a cool, indifferent manner, which made his
rebukes more cutting. Now he was in wrathful earnest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill03" id="ill03"></a>
<a href="images/ill03h.png"><img src="images/ill03.png" width="400" height="543" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;SOME OF US WILL LIVE TO SEE THOMAS OF CANTERBURY A
SAINT OF THE CHURCH&rsquo;&rdquo;" title="Click for larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;SOME OF US WILL LIVE TO SEE THOMAS OF CANTERBURY A
SAINT OF THE CHURCH&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ambrosius,&rdquo; he thundered, &ldquo;there are some of us who will
live to see Thomas of Canterbury a Saint of the Church.
But that is no reason why we should gabble about it beforehand.
You have been thinking yourself a writer, have you?
Your place here has been allowed you because you are&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a rule&mdash;cautious even to timidity. Silence is always safe,
and an indiscreet pen is ruinous. The children of the brain
travel far, and they must not discuss their betters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we write then of the doings of binds and swinkers?&rdquo;
asked the historian, pursing his heavy mouth. &ldquo;It seems we
cannot write of Kings and of Saints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may write anything in reason of Kings and of Saints&mdash;when
they are dead,&rdquo; the Abbot retorted. &ldquo;But if you cannot
avoid treasonable criticism of your King, I will find another
historian. Go now to your penance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Brother Ambrosius, not venturing a reply, slunk out.</p>

<p>In the last three minutes Brother Basil had seen far beneath
the surface of things. His deep-set blue eyes flamed. The
dullness of the chronicle was not always the dullness of
the author, it seemed. The King showed at best none too
much respect for the Church, and his courtiers had dared the
murder of Becket. Surely the Abbot was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Basil,&rdquo; his superior observed grimly, &ldquo;in a world full of
fools it would be strange if some were not found here. It
is the business of the Church to make all men alike useful to
God. Because the murder of an Archbishop has set all Christendom
a-buzz, we must be the more zealous to give no just
cause of offence. I do not believe that Henry is guilty of
that murder, but if he were, he would not shrink from other
crimes. In the one case we have no reason to condemn him;
in the other, we must be silent or court our own destruction.
There are other ways of keeping alive the memory of Thomas
of Canterbury besides foolish accusations in black and white.
There may be pictures, which the people will see, ballads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which they will hear and repeat&mdash;the very towers of the
Cathedral will be his monument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent for you now because there is work for you
to do elsewhere. The road from Paris to Byzantium may soon
be blocked. The Emperor of Germany is at open war with
the Pope. Turks are attacking pilgrims in the Holy Land.
Soon it may be impossible, even for a monk, to make the journey
safely. The time to go is now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will set forth within a fortnight, and go to Rouen,
Paris and Limoges; thence to Rome, Byzantium and Alexandria.
I will give you memoranda of certain manuscripts
which you are to secure if possible, either by purchase or
by securing permission to make copies. Get as many more
as you can. The King is coming here to-night in company
with the Archbishop of York, the Chancellor, a Prince of Ireland,
and others. He may buy or order some works on the
ancient law. He desires also to found an Abbey in Ireland,
to be a cell of this house. I have selected Cuthbert of Oxenford
to take charge of the work, and he will set out immediately
with twelve brethren to make the foundation. When
you return from your journey it will doubtless be well under
way. You will begin there the training of scribes, artists,
metal workers and other craftsmen. It is true that you know
little of any work except that of the scriptorium, but one can
learn to know men there as well as anywhere. You will
observe what is done in France, Lombardy and Byzantium.
The men to whom you will have letters will make you acquainted
with young craftsmen who may be induced to go to
Ireland to work, and teach their work to others. Little can
be done toward establishing a school until Ireland is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
quiet, but in this the King believes that we shall be of some
assistance. I desire you to be present at our conference, to
make notes as you are directed, and to say nothing, for the
present, of these matters. Ambrosius may think that you are
to have his place, and that will be very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Abbot concluded with a rather ominous little smile.
Brother Basil went back to the scriptorium, his head in a
whirl. Within a twelvemonth he would see the mosaics of
Saint Mark&rsquo;s in Venice, the glorious windows of the French
cathedrals, the dome of Saint Sophia, the wonders of the
Holy Land. He was no longer part of a machine. Indeed,
he must always have been more than that, or the Abbot
would not have chosen him for this work. He felt very
humble and very happy.</p>

<p>He knew that he must study architecture above anything
else, for the building done by the monks was for centuries
to come. Each brother of the Order gathered wisdom for
all. When a monk of distinguished ability learned how to
strengthen an arch here or carve a doorway there, his work
was seen and studied by others from a hundred towns and
cities. Living day by day with their work, the builders detected
weaknesses and proved step by step all that they did.
Cuthbert of Oxenford was a sure and careful mason, but
that was all. The beauty of the building would have to be
created by another man. Glass-work, goldsmith work, mosaics,
vestments and books might be brought from abroad,
but the stone-work must be done with materials near at hand
and such labor as could be had. Brother Basil received letters
not only to Abbots and Bishops, but to Gerard the wood-carver
of Amiens, Matteo the Florentine artist, Tomaso the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
physician of Padua, Angelo the glass-maker. He set all in
order in the scriptorium where he had toiled for five long
years. Then, having been diligent in business, he went to
stand before the King.</p>

<p>Many churchmen pictured this Plantagenet with horns and
a cloven foot, and muttered references to the old fairy tale
about a certain ancestor of the family who married a witch.
But Brother Basil was familiar with the records of history.
He knew the fierce Norman blood of the race, and knew also
the long struggle between Matilda, this King&rsquo;s mother, and
Stephen. Here, in the plainly furnished room of the Abbot,
was a hawk-nosed man with gray eyes and a stout restless
figure, broad coarse hands, and slightly bowed legs, as if he
spent most of his days in the saddle. The others, churchmen
and courtiers, looked far more like royalty. Yet Henry&rsquo;s
realm took in all England, a part of Ireland, and a half of what
is now France. He was the only real rival to the German
Emperor who had defied and driven into exile the Pope of
Rome. If Henry were of like mind with Frederick Barbarossa
it would be a sorry day indeed for the Church. If he were
disposed to contend with Barbarossa for the supreme power
over Europe, the land would be worn out with wars. What
would he do? Brother Basil watched the debating group
and tried to make up his mind.</p>

<p>He wrote now and then a paragraph at the Abbot&rsquo;s command.
It seemed that the King claimed certain taxes and
service from the churchmen who held estates under him,
precisely as from the feudal nobles. The Abbots and Bishops,
while claiming the protection of English law for their property,
claimed also that they owed no obedience to the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
but only to their spiritual master. Argument after argument
was advanced by their trained minds.</p>

<p>But it was not for amusement that Henry&nbsp;II., after a day
with some hunting Abbot, falcon on fist, read busily in books
of law. Brother Basil began to see that the King was defining,
little by little, a code of England based on the old
Roman law and customs handed down from the primitive
British village. Would he at last obey the Church, or not?</p>

<p>Suddenly the monarch halted in his pacing of the room,
turned and faced the group. The lightning of his eye flashed
from one to another, and all drew back a little except the
Abbot, who listened with the little grim smile that the monks
knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell ye,&rdquo; said Henry, bringing his hard fist down upon
the oaken table, &ldquo;Pope or no Pope, Emperor or no Emperor,
I will be King of England, and this land shall be fief to no
King upon earth. I will have neither two masters to my
dogs, nor two laws to my realm. Hear ye that, my lords
and councilors?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>III<br />
<br />
THE PICTURE IN THE WINDOW<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW ALAN OF THE ABBEY FARMS LEARNED TO MAKE STAINED
GLASS</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Alan</span> sat kicking his heels on the old Roman wall
which was the most solid part of the half-built cathedral.
He had been born and brought up on a farm
not far away, and had never seen a town or a shop,
although he was nearly thirteen years old. Around the great
house in which the monks of the abbey lived there were a
few houses of a low and humble sort, and the farm-houses
thereabouts were comfortable; but there was no town in the
neighborhood. The monks had come there in the beginning
because it was a lonely place which no one wanted, and
because they could have for the asking a great deal of land
which did not seem to be good for anything. After they
had settled there they proceeded to drain the marshes, fell
the woods in prudent moderation, plant orchards and raise
cattle and sheep and poultry.</p>

<p>Alan&rsquo;s father was one of the farmers who held land under
the Abbey, as his father and grandfather had done before
him. He paid his rent out of the wool from his flocks, for
very soon the sheep had increased far beyond the ability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the monks to look after them. Sometimes, when a new
wall was to be built or an old one repaired, he lent a hand
with the work, for he was a shrewd and honest builder of
common masonry and a good carpenter as well. The cathedral
had been roofed in so that services could be held there,
but there was only one small chapel, and the towers were
not even begun. All that would have to be done when money
came to hand, and what with the King&rsquo;s wars in Normandy,
and against the Scots, his expedition to Ireland, and his difficulties
with his own barons, the building trade in that part
of England was a poor one.</p>

<p>Alan wondered, as he tilted his chin back to look up at
the strong and graceful arches of the windows near by, whether
he should ever see any more of it built. In the choir there
were bits of stone carving which he always liked to look at,
but there were only a few statues, and no glass windows.
Brother Basil, who had traveled in France and Italy and
had taught Alan something of drawing, said that in the
cities where he had been, there were marvelous cathedrals
with splendid carved towers and windows like jeweled flowers
or imprisoned flame, but no such glories were to be found
in England at that time.</p>

<p>The boy looked beyond the gray wall at the gold and
ruby and violet of the sunset clouds behind the lace-work
of the bare elms, and wondered if the cathedral windows were
as beautiful as that. He had an idea that they might be like
the colored pictures in an old book which Brother Basil had
brought from Rome, which he said had been made still further
east in Byzantium&mdash;the city which we know as Constantinople.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In the arched doorway which led from the garden into the
orchard some one was standing&mdash;a small old man, bent and
tired-looking, with a pack on his shoulder. Alan slid off
the stone ledge and ran down the path. The old man had
taken off his cap and was rubbing his forehead wearily. His
eyes were big and dark, his hair and beard were dark and
fine, his face was lined with delicate wrinkles, and he did not
look in the least like the people of the village. His voice
was soft and pleasant, and though he spoke English, he did
not pronounce it like the village people, or like the monks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This&mdash;is the cathedral?&rdquo; he said in a disappointed way,
as if he had expected something quite different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled Alan, for he spoke as all the farmer-folk
did, with a kind of twang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are doing no work here,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>

<p>Alan shook his head. &ldquo;It has been like this ever since I
can remember. Father says there&rsquo;s no knowing when it will
be finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man sighed, and then broke out in a quick patter
of talk, as if he really could not help telling his story to
some one. Alan could not understand all that he said, but
he began to see why the stranger was so disappointed. He
was Italian; he had come to London from France, and only
two days after landing he had had a fall and broken his
leg, so that he had been lame ever since. Then he had been
robbed of his money. Some one had told him that there was
an unfinished cathedral here, and he had come all the way
on foot in the hope of finding work. Now, it seemed, there
was no work to be had.</p>

<p>What interested Alan was that this old man had really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
helped to build the wonderful French cathedrals of which
Brother Basil had told, and he was sure that if Brother Basil
were here, something might be done. But he was away, on a
pilgrimage; the abbot was away too; and Brother Peter, the
porter, did not like strangers. Alan decided that the best
thing to do would be to take the old man home and explain
to his mother.</p>

<p>Dame Cicely at the Abbey Farm was usually inclined to
give Alan what he asked, because he seldom asked anything.
He was rather fond of spending his time roaming about the
moors, or trying to draw pictures of things that he had seen
or heard of; and she was not sure whether he would ever
make a farmer or not. She was touched by the old man&rsquo;s
troubles, and liked his polite ways; and Alan very soon had
the satisfaction of seeing his new friend warm and comfortable
in the chimney-corner. The rambling old farm-house
had all sorts of rooms in it, and there was a little room in
the older part, which had a window looking toward the sunset,
a straw bed, a bench, and a fireplace, for it had once been
used as a kitchen. It was never used now except at harvest-time,
and the stranger could have that.</p>

<p>Nobody in the household, except Alan, could make much
of the old man&rsquo;s talk. The maids laughed at his way of
speaking English; the men soon found that he knew nothing
of cattle-raising, or plowing, or carpentering, or thatching,
or sheep-shearing. But Alan hung about the little room in
all his spare time, brought fagots for the fire, answered questions,
begged, borrowed or picked up somewhere whatever
seemed to be needed, and watched with fascinated eyes all
the doings that went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man&rsquo;s name, it appeared, was Angelo Pisano, and
he had actually made cathedral windows, all by himself.
Although Italian born, he had spent much of his life in
France, and had known men of many nations, including the
English. He meant now to make a window to show the Abbot
when he returned, and then, perhaps, the Abbot would either
let him stay and work for the Church, or help him to find
work somewhere else.</p>

<p>The first thing that he did was to mix, in a black iron
pot that Alan found among rubbish, some sand and other
mysterious ingredients, and then the fire must be kept up
evenly, without a minute&rsquo;s inattention, until exactly the proper
time, when the molten mass was lifted out in a lump on the
end of a long iron pipe. Alan held his breath as the old man
blew it into a great fragile crimson bubble, and then, so
deftly and quickly that the boy did not see just how, cut the
bottle-shaped hollow glass down one side and flattened it
out, a transparent sheet of rose-red that was smooth and even
for the most part, and thick and uneven around a part of
the edge.</p>

<p>Everything had to be done a little at a time. Angelo
was working with such materials as he could get, and the glass
did not always turn out as he meant it should. Twice it
was an utter failure and had to be re-melted and worked all
over again. Once it was even finer in color than it would
have been if made exactly by the rule. Angelo said that
some impurity in the metal which gave the color had made a
more beautiful blue than he expected. Dame Cicely happened
to be there when they were talking it over, and nodded wisely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis often that way,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I remember once in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
baking, the oven was too cold and I made sure the pasties
would be slack-baked, and they was better than ever we had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan was not sure what the glassmaker would think of this
taking it for granted that cookery was as much a craft as the
making of windows, but the old man nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that there is a gramarye in the nature of things,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and God to keep us from being too wise in our
own conceit lets it now and then bring all our wisdom to
folly. Now, my son, we will store these away where no harm
can come to them, for I have never known God to work
miracles for the careless, and we have no more than time to
finish the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had sheets of red, blue, green, yellow and clear white
glass, not very large, but beautifully clear and shining, and
these were set carefully in a corner with a block of wood in
front of them for protection.</p>

<p>Then Angelo fell silent and pulled at his beard. The
little money that he had was almost gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan, my son,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;do you know what
lead is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan nodded. &ldquo;The roof of the chapel was covered with
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the chapel that burned down. The lead melted
and rained down on the floor, and burned Brother Basil when
he ran in to save the book with the colored pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glass-worker smiled. &ldquo;Your Brother Basil,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;must have the soul of an artist. I wonder now what became
of that lead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They saved a little, but most of it is mixed up with the
rubbish and the ashes,&rdquo; Alan said confidently. &ldquo;Do you
want it?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Angelo spread his hands with a funny little gesture. &ldquo;Want
it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where did they put those ashes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lead was a costly thing in the Middle Ages. It was
sometimes used for roofing purposes, as well as for gutter-pipes
and drain-pipes, because it will not rust as iron will, and can
easily be worked. Alan had played about that rubbish heap,
and he knew that there were lumps of lead among the wood-ashes
and crumbled stones. Much marveling, he led the
artist to the pile of rubbish that had been thrown over the
wall, and helped to dig out the precious bits of metal. Then
the fire was lighted once more, and triumphantly Angelo
melted the lead and purified it, and rolled it into sheets, and
cut it into strips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said one morning, &ldquo;we are ready to begin. I
shall make a medallion which can be set in a great window
like embroidery on a curtain. It shall be a picture&mdash;of what,
my son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His dark eyes were very kind as he looked at the boy&rsquo;s eager
face. The question had come so suddenly that Alan found
no immediate answer. Then he saw his pet lamb delicately
nibbling at a bit of green stuff which his mother held out to it
as she stood in her blue gown and white apron, her bright hair
shining under her cap.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we could make a picture of her,&rdquo; he said a little
doubtfully. Angelo smiled, and with a bit of charcoal he
made a sketch on a board. Alan watched with wonder-widened
eyes, although he had seen the old man draw before.
Then they went together into the little room which had seen
so many surprising things, and the sketch was copied on the
broad wooden bench which they had been using for a table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Then holding one end of a piece of string in the middle of
the lamb&rsquo;s back, Angelo slipped the charcoal through a loop in
the other end, and drew a circle round the whole. Around
this he drew a wreath of flowers and leaves. Then he laid the
white glass over the lamb and drew the outline just as a child
would draw on a transparent slate, putting in the curls of the
wool, the eyes and ears and hoofs, with quick, sure touches.
This done, he set the white glass aside, and drew Dame Cicely&rsquo;s
blue gown and the blue of a glimpse of sky on the blue glass.
The green of the grass and the bushes was drawn on the green
glass, and the roses on the red, and on the yellow, the cowslips
in the grass. When all these had been cut out with a sharp
tool, they fitted together exactly like the bits of a picture-puzzle,
but with a little space between, for each bit of the picture
had been drawn a trifle inside the line to leave room for
the framework.</p>

<p>Now it began to be obvious what the lead was for. With
the same deftness he had shown throughout the old glass-worker
bent the strips of lead, which had been heated just
enough to make them flexible, in and out and around the edges
of the pieces of colored glass, which were held in place as the
leaden strips were bent down over the edges, as a picture is
held in the frame. When the work was finished, the medallion
was a picture in colored glass, of a woman of gracious and
kindly bearing, a pale gold halo about her face, her hand on
the head of a white lamb, and a wreath of blossoms around
the whole. When the sun shone through it, the leaden lines
might have been a black network holding a mass of gems.
Dame Cicely looked at it with awed wonder, and the lamb
bleated cheerfully, as if he knew his own likeness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill04" id="ill04"></a>
<a href="images/ill04h.png"><img src="images/ill04.png" width="400" height="473" alt="&ldquo;THE MEDALLION WAS A PICTURE IN COLORED GLASS&rdquo;" title="Click for larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;THE MEDALLION WAS A PICTURE IN COLORED GLASS&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Then there was an exclamation from the gateway, and they
turned to see a thin-faced man in the robe and sandals of
a monk, with sea-blue eyes alight in joy and surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, indeed, Angelo!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They told me
that a glass-worker was doing marvelous things here, and I
heard a twelvemonth since that you were leaving Normandy
for England. Where have you been all this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that after much talk of old times
and new times, Angelo was asked to make a series of stained
glass windows for the Abbey, with all the aid that the friendship
of the Abbot and Brother Basil could supply. He kept
his little room at the farm, where he could see the sunset
through the trees, and have the comfortable care of Dame
Cicely when he found the cold of the North oppressive; but
he had a glass-house of his own, fitted up close by the Abbey,
and there Alan worked with him. The Abbot had met in
Rouen a north-country nobleman, of the great Vavasour family,
who had married a Flemish wife and was coming shortly
to live on his estates within a few miles of the Abbey. He
desired to have a chapel built in honor of the patron saint of
his family, and had given money for that, and also for the
windows in the Abbey. The Abbot had been thinking that he
should have to send for these windows to some glass-house
on the Continent, and when he found that the work could be
done close at hand by a master of the craft, he was more than
pleased. With cathedrals and churches a-building all over England,
and the Abbot to make his work known to other builders
of his Order, there was no danger that Angelo would be
without work in the future. Some day, he said, Alan should
go as a journeyman and see for himself all the cathedral windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in Italy and France, but for the present he must stick
to the glass-house. And this Alan was content to do, for he
was learning, day by day, all that could be learned from a
man superior to most artists of either France or Italy.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<br />
THE GRASSHOPPERS&rsquo; LIBRARY<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW RANULPH LE PROVENÇAL CEASED TO BE A MINSTREL
AND BECAME A TROUBADOUR</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">On</span> a hillside above a stone-terraced oval hollow, a
youth lay singing softly to himself and making such
music as he could upon a rote. The instrument was
of the sort which King David had in mind when he
said, &ldquo;Awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early.&rdquo;
It was a box-shaped thing like a zither, which at one time had
probably owned ten strings. The player was adapting his
music as best he might to favor its peculiarities. Notwithstanding
his debonair employment, he did not look as if he
were on very good terms with life. His cloak and hose were
shabby and weather-stained, his doublet was still less presentable,
his cheeks were hollow, and there were dark circles under
his eyes. Presently he abandoned the song altogether, and
lay, chin in hand, staring down into the grass-grown, ancient
pit.</p>

<p>It had begun its history as a Roman amphitheater, a thousand
years before. Gladiators had fought and wild beasts
had raged in that arena, whose encircling wall was high
enough to defy the leap of the most agile of lions. Up here,
on the hillside, in the archways outside the outermost ring of
seats, the slaves had watched the combats. The youth had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
heard something about these old imperial customs, and he had
guessed that he had come upon a haunt of the Roman colonists
who had founded a forgotten town near by. He wondered, as
he lay there, if he himself were in any better ease than those
unknown captives, who had fought and died for the amusement
of their owners.</p>

<p>Ranulph le Provençal, as he was one day to be known, was
the son of a Provençal father and a Norman mother. In the
siege of a town his father had been killed and his mother had
died of starvation, and he himself had barely escaped with
life. That had been the penalty of being on the wrong side of
the struggle between the Normans of Anjou and their unwilling
subjects in Aquitaine. At the moment the rebellious
counts of Aquitaine were getting the best of it. Ranulph
knew little of the tangled politics of the time, but it seemed
to him that all France was turned into a cockpit in which the
sovereign counts of France, who were jealous of their independence,
and the fierce pride of the Angevin dukes who tried
to keep a foothold in both France and England, and the determined
ambition of the King who sat in Paris, were warring
over the enslavement of an unhappy people. He himself had
no chance of becoming a knight; his life was broken off before
it had fairly begun. He got his living by wandering from one
place to another making songs. He had a voice, and could
coax music out of almost any sort of instrument; and he had
a trick of putting new words to familiar tunes that made folk
laugh and listen.</p>

<p>Neighborhood quarrels had drained money and spirit out
of the part of the country where he was, and he had almost
forgotten what it was like to have enough to eat. The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
dog that had followed him through his wanderings for a year
foraged for scraps and fared better than his master; but now
small Zipero was hungry too. The little fellow had been
mauled by a mastiff that morning, and a blow from a porter&rsquo;s
staff had broken his leg. Ranulph had rescued his comrade at
some cost to himself, and might not have got off so easily if a
sudden sound of trumpets had not cleared the way for a king&rsquo;s
vanguard. As the soldiers rode in at the gates the young
minstrel folded his dog in his cloak and limped out along the
highway. Up here in the shade of some bushes by the deserted
ruins, he had done what he could for his pet, but the
little whimper Zipero gave now and then seemed to go through
his heart.</p>

<p>Life had been difficult before, but he had been stronger,
or more ignorant. He had made blithe songs when he was
anything but gay at heart; he had laughed when others were
weeping and howling; he had danced to his own music when
every inch of his body ached with weariness; and it had all
come to this. He had been turned out of his poor lodgings
because he had no money; he had been driven out of the town
because he would not take money earned in a certain way.
He seemed to have come to the end.</p>

<p>If that were the case he might as well make a song about
it and see what it would be like. He took up the rote, and
began to work out a refrain that was singing itself in his head.
Zipero listened; he was quieter when he heard the familiar
sound. The song was flung like a challenge into the silent
arena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;So you believe that, my son?&rdquo; asked a voice behind him.
He sat up and looked about; an old man in a long dusky cloak
and small flat cap had come over the brow of the hill. He
answered, a trifle <a name="defiantly" id="defiantly"></a>defiantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps I do. At any rate, that is the song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is true,&rdquo; the old man said quietly as he knelt beside
Zipero on the turf. He examined the bandages on the little
dog&rsquo;s neck and forelegs, undid them, laid some bruised leaves
from his basket on the wounds. The small creature, with his
eyes on his master&rsquo;s face, licked the stranger&rsquo;s hand gratefully
to show that he was more at ease. &ldquo;Man alone is free. This
herb cannot change itself; it must heal; that one must slay.
Saturn is ever the Greater Malignant; our Lady Venus cannot
rule war, nor can Mars rule a Court of Love. The most
uncertain creature in the world is a man. The stars themselves
cannot force me to revile God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph was silent. After months and years among rude
street crowds, the dignity and kindliness of the old man&rsquo;s ways
were like a voice from another world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can cure this little animal,&rdquo; the stranger went on presently,
&ldquo;if you will let me take him to my lodgings, where I
have certain salves and medicines. I shall be pleased if you
will come also, unless you are occupied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph laughed; that was absurd. &ldquo;I am a street singer,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;My time is not in demand at present. I must tell
you, however, that the Count is my enemy&mdash;if a friendless
beggar can have such a thing. One of his varlets set his
ban-dog on us both, this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will give me no trouble,&rdquo; said the old man quietly.
&ldquo;Come, children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph got to his feet and followed with Zipero in his
arms. At the foot of the hill on the other side was a nondescript
building which had grown up around what was left of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a Roman house. The unruined pillars and strongly cemented
stone-work contrasted oddly with the thatch and tile of peasant
workmen. They passed through a gate where an old and
wrinkled woman peered through a window at them, then they
went up a flight of stairs outside the wall to a tower-room
in the third story. A chorus of welcome arose from a strange
company of creatures, caged and free: finches, linnets, a parrot,
a raven which sidled up at once to have its head scratched,
pigeons strutting and cooing on the window-ledge, and a large
cat of a slaty-blue color with solemn, topaz eyes, which took
no more note of Zipero than if he had been a dog of stone. A
basket was provided for the small patient, near the window
that looked out over the hills; the old servingwoman brought
food, simple but well-cooked and delicious, and Ranulph was
motioned to a seat at the table. It was all done so easily and
quickly that dinner was over before Ranulph found words
for the gratitude which filled his soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not tell me,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly at last, &ldquo;to
whom I may offer my thanks&mdash;and service&mdash;if I may not serve
you in some way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give to some one else in need, when you can,&rdquo; said his
host calmly. &ldquo;I am Tomaso of Padua. A physician&rsquo;s business
is healing, wherever he finds sickness in man or beast.
Your little friend there needed certain things; your need is
for other things; the man who is now coming up the stairs
needs something else.&rdquo; Taking a harp from a corner he added,
&ldquo;Perhaps you will amuse yourself with this for an hour, while
I see what that knock at the door means, this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whoever the visitor was, he was shown into another room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and Ranulph presently forgot all his troubles and almost lost
the consciousness of his surroundings, as the harp sang under
his hand. He began to put into words a song which had been
haunting him for days,&mdash;a ballad of a captive knight who
spent seven long years in Fairyland, but in spite of all that
the Fairy Queen&rsquo;s enchantment could do, never forgot his own
people. Many of the popular romances of the time were fairy-tales
full of magic spells, giants, caverns within the hills,
witches and wood-folk hoofed and horned like Pan, sea-monsters,
palaces which appeared and vanished like moon-shine.
When they were sung to the harp-music of a troubadour
who knew his work, they seemed very real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a good song,&rdquo; said a stranger who had come in so
quietly that Ranulph did not see him. &ldquo;Did you find it in
Spain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph stood up and bowed with the grace that had not
left him in all his wandering life. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, his dark
eyes glinting with laughter, &ldquo;I learned it in the Grasshoppers&rsquo;
Library. I beg your pardon, master,&mdash;that is a saying we
have in Provence. You will guess the meaning. A learned
physician found me there, studying diligently though perhaps
not over-profitably upon a hillside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not bad at all,&rdquo; said the stranger, sitting down by Ranulph
in the window and running over the melody on the harp. His
fingers swept the strings in a confident power that showed him
a master-musician, and he began a song so full of wonder,
mystery and sweetness that Ranulph listened spellbound.
Neither of them knew that for centuries after they sat there
singing in a ruined Roman tower, the song would be known
to all the world as the legend of Parzifal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I too have studied in the Grasshoppers&rsquo; Library,&rdquo; said the
singer, &ldquo;but I found in an ancient book among the infidels in
Spain this tale of a cup of enchantment, and made use of it.
I think that it is one of those songs which do not die, but
travel far and wide in many disguises, and end perhaps in the
Church. You are one of us, are you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a street singer,&rdquo; Ranulph answered, &ldquo;a jongleur&mdash;a
jester. I make songs for this,&rdquo;&mdash;he took up his battered rote
and hummed a camp-chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you play like that&mdash;on that?&rdquo;
asked the other. &ldquo;Your studies must have led you indeed to
Fairyland. You ought to go to England. The Plantagenets
are friendly to us troubadours, and the English are a merry
people, who delight in songs and the hearing of tales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph did not answer. Going to England and going to
Fairyland were not in the same class of undertaking. Fairyland
might be just over the border of the real world, but it
cost money to cross the seas.</p>

<p>Tomaso came in just then, his deep-set eyes twinkling. &ldquo;It
is all right,&rdquo; he said, nodding to the troubadour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been telling our friend here that he should go to
England,&rdquo; said the latter, rising and putting on his cloak.
&ldquo;If, as you say, his father was loyal to the House of Anjou,
Henry will remember it. He is a wise old fox, is Henry, and
he needs men whom he can trust. He is changing laws, and
that is no easy thing to do when you have a stubborn people
with all sorts of ideas in their heads about custom, and tradition,
and what not. He wants to make things safe for his
sons, and the throne on which he sits is rocking. The French
king is greedy and the Welsh are savage, and Italian galleys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
crowd the very Pool of London. I remember me when I was
a student in Paris, a Welsh clerk&mdash;he calls himself now Giraldus
Cambrensis, but his name then was Gerald Barri,&mdash;had
the room over mine, the year that Philip was born. We woke
up one night to find the whole street ablaze with torches and
lanterns, and two old crones dancing under our windows with
lighted torches in their hands, howling for joy. Barri stuck
his head out of window and asked what ailed them, and one of
them screamed in her cracked voice, &lsquo;We have got a Prince
now who will drive you all out of France some day, you
Englishmen!&rsquo; I can see his face now as he shouted back
something that assuredly was not French. I tell you, Philip
will hate the English like his father before him, and these are
times when a troubadour who can keep a merry face and a close
tongue will learn much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the door closed the physician sat down in his round-backed
chair, resting his long, wrinkled hands upon the arms.
&ldquo;Well, my son,&rdquo; he said in his unperturbed voice, &ldquo;I find somebody
yonder is very sorry that you were thrown out of the
gates this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph glanced up quickly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had no idea that you were here, of course. He came
to get me to ask the stars what had become of you, as you
could not be found on the road. When he found that you
would not serve him in the matter of the dagger and the
poison, he never intended to let you leave the town, but as you
know, your dog, seeing you mishandled, flew at his varlet,
and the thick-headed fellow drove you out before he had any
further orders. By such small means,&rdquo; old Tomaso stroked
Zipero&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;are evil plans made of no account.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Ranulph drew a long breath. He had lost color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;you must not shelter me if he is
thus determined. He will take vengeance on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physician smiled. &ldquo;He dares not. He is afraid of
the stars. He knows also that I hold the death of every soul
in his house in some small vial such as this&mdash;and he does not
know which one. He knows that I have only to reveal to any
minstrel what I know of his plans and his doings, and he would
be driven from the court of his own sovereign. He can never
be sure what I am going to do, and he does not know himself
what he is going to do, so that he fears every one. By the
twelve Houses of Fate, it must be unpleasant to be so given
over to hatred!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my son, let us consider. You heard what Christian
said but now of the need of the House of Anjou for faithful
service. A trouvère can go where others cannot. He knows
what others dare not ask. He can say what others cannot.
Were it not for that prince of mischief and minstrelsy, Bertran
de Born, Henry and his folk would have been at peace long
ago. Know men&rsquo;s hearts, and though you are a beggar in the
market-place, you can turn them as a man turns a stream with
a wooden dam. You shall go with Christian to Troyes and
thence to Tours, and I will keep your little friend here until
he is restored, and bring him to you when I come to that place.
If search is made for you it will be made in Venice, where they
think you have gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph, with the aid of his new friends, went forth with
proper harp and new raiment a day or two afterward, and
repaid the loan of old Tomaso when he met the latter in Tours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
some six months later. He did not give up his studies in the
Grasshoppers&rsquo; Library, but the lean years were at an end both
for him and for Zipero.</p>

<h2>V<br />
<br />
THE BOX THAT QUENTIN CARVED<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW QUENTIN OF PERONNE LEARNED HIS TRADE WHEN A
BOY IN AMIENS</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Any</span> one who happened to be in the market-place of
Amiens one sunshiny summer morning in the last quarter
of the twelfth century, might have seen a slim,
dark, dreamy-eyed boy wandering about with teeth set
in a ripe golden apricot, looking at all there was to be seen.
But the chances were that no one who was there did see him,
because people were very busy with their own affairs, and
there was much to look at, far more important and interesting
than a boy. In fact Quentin, who had come with his father,
Jean of Peronne, to town that very morning, was not important
to any one except his father and himself.</p>

<p>They had been living in a small village of Northern France,
where they had a tiny farm, but when the mother died, Jean
left the two older boys to take care of the fields, and with his
youngest son, who was most like the mother, started out to
find work elsewhere. He was a good mason, and masons were
welcome anywhere. In all French cities and many towns
cathedrals, castles or churches were a-building, and no one
would think of building them of anything but stone.</p>

<p>While Quentin speculated on life as it might be in this new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and interesting place, there was a shout of warning, a cry of
terror from a woman near by, a dull rumble and crash, and a
crowd began to gather in the street beside the cathedral. Before
the boy could reach the place, a man in the garb of a
Benedictine monk detached himself from the group and came
toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;you are Quentin, from Peronne?
Yes? Do not be frightened, but I must tell you that your
father has been hurt. They are taking him to a house near by,
and if you will come with me, I will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next few days were anxious ones for Quentin. His
father did not die, but it was certain that he would do no more
work as a mason for years, if ever. One of the older brothers
came to take him home, and it was taken for granted that
Quentin would go also. But the boy had a plan in his head.</p>

<p>There was none too much to eat at home, as it was, and it
would be a long time before he was strong enough to handle
stone like his father. Brother Basil, the monk who had seen
his father caught under the falling wall, helped to rescue him,
and taken care that he did not lose sight of his boy, had been
very kind, but he did not belong in Amiens; he was on his way
to Rome. Quentin met him outside the house on the day that
Pierre came in from Peronne, and gave him a questioning look.
He was wondering if Brother Basil would understand.</p>

<p>The smile that answered his look was encouraging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; said Brother Basil in his quaintly spoken
French, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quentin stood very straight, cap in hand. &ldquo;I do not want
to go home,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I want to stay here&mdash;and
work.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; asked the monk.</p>

<p>Quentin nodded. &ldquo;Marc and Pierre work all day in the
fields, and I am of no use there; they said so. Pierre said it
again just now. I am not strong enough yet to be of use.
There is work here that I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He traced the outline of an ancient bit of carving on the
woodwork of the overhanging doorway with one small finger.
&ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; he said confidently.</p>

<p>Brother Basil&rsquo;s black eyebrows lifted a trifle and his mouth
twitched; the boy was such a scrap of a boy. Yet he had seen
enough of the oaken choir-stalls and the carved chests and the
wainscoting of Amiens to know that a French wood-carver is
often born with skill in his brain and his fingers, and can do
things when a mere apprentice that others must be trained to
do. &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I carved a box for the mother, and when the cousin Adele
saw it she would have one too. It was made with a wreath
of roses on the lid, but I would not make roses for any one but
the mother; Adele&rsquo;s box has lilies, and a picture of herself.
That she liked better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Basil was thinking. &ldquo;Quentin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know a
wood-carver here, Master Gerard, who is from Peronne, and
knows your talk better than I. He was a boy like you when
he began to learn the work of the huchier and the wood-carver,
and he might give you a place in his shop. Will your father
let you stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will if I get the chance,&rdquo; said Quentin. &ldquo;If I ask him
now, Pierre will say things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like many younger brothers, Quentin knew more about the
older members of his family than they knew about him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Brother Basil&rsquo;s smile escaped control this time. He turned
and strode across the market-place to the shop of Master
Gerard, beckoning Quentin to follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he said to the old huchier, who was planing and
chipping and shaping a piece of Spanish chestnut, &ldquo;here is a
boy who has fallen in love with your trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Gerard glanced up in some surprise. &ldquo;He likes the
trade, does he?&rdquo; was the gruff comment he made. &ldquo;Does the
trade like him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is for you to say,&rdquo; said Brother Basil, and turning
on his heel he went out, to walk up and down in the sunshine
before the door and meditate on the loves of craftsmen for
their crafts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; asked the old man shortly, still working
at his piece of chestnut.</p>

<p>Quentin took from his pouch a bit of wood on which he had
carved, very carefully, the figure of a monk at a reading-desk
with a huge volume before him. He had done it the day
before after he had been with Brother Basil to bring some
books from the Bishop&rsquo;s house, and although the figure was too
small and his knife had been too clumsy to make much of a
portrait of the face, he had caught exactly the intent pose of
the head and the characteristic attitude of the monk&rsquo;s angular
figure. Master Gerard frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of carving is that!&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;The wood is
coarse and the tools were not right. You tell me you did it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quentin stood his ground. &ldquo;It is my work, Master,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I had only this old knife, and I know the wood is not
right, but it was all that I had.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you want to learn my trade&mdash;eh?&rdquo; said the old man
a little more kindly. &ldquo;You have no father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quentin explained. Master Gerard looked doubtful. He
had met boys before who liked to whittle, and wished to work
in his shop; he had apprentices whose fathers were good workmen
and wished their sons to learn more than they could
teach; but very seldom did he meet a boy who would work as
he himself had worked when he was a lad, never satisfied
with what he did, because the vision in his mind ran ahead of
the power in his fingers. He was an old man now, but he was
still seeing what might be done in wood-working if a man
could only have a chance to come back, after he had spent one
lifetime in learning, and use what he had learned, in the
strength of a new, clear-sighted youth. He had sons of his
own, but they were only good business men. They could sell
the work, but they had no inspirations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will let you try what you can do,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;that
is, if your father is willing. Tell him to come and see me before
he goes home. And look you&mdash;come back when you have
told him this, and copy this work of yours in the proper
fashion, with tools and wood which I will give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quentin bowed, thanked the old wood-carver, walked, by a
great effort, steadily out of the shop and answered a question
of Brother Basil&rsquo;s, and then flashed like a squirrel in a hurry
across the square and up the narrow winding stair in the side
street where his father lodged, with the news. Pierre began
two or three sentences, but never finished them. Jean of
Peronne knew all about Master Gerard, and was only too glad
to hear of such a chance for his motherless boy. And all the
happy, sunlit afternoon Quentin sat in a corner, working away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
with keen-edged tools that were a joy to the hand, at a
smooth-grained, close-fibered bit of wood that never splintered
or split.</p>

<p>Master Gerard was what might be called a carpenter, or
cabinet-maker. He did not make doors or window-frames, or
woodwork for houses, because the great houses of that day
were built almost entirely of stone. Neither did he make furniture
such as chairs, tables, or bureaus, because it was not yet
thought of. Kings&rsquo; households and great families moved
about from castle to castle, and carried with them by boat,
or in heavy wagons over bad roads, whatever comforts they
owned. Modern furniture would have been fit for kindling-wood
in a year, but ancient French luggage was built for hard
travel. Master Gerard made chests of solid, well-seasoned
wood, chosen with care and put together without nails, by
fitting notch into notch at the corners. These were called
huches, and Master Gerard was a master huchier.</p>

<p>These huches were longer and lower than a large modern
trunk, and could be set one on another, after they were carried
up narrow twisting stairways on men&rsquo;s shoulders. The lid
might be all in one piece, but more often it was in halves, with
a bar between, so that when the chest was set on its side or end
the lids would form doors. Ledges at top and bottom protected
the corners and edges, and there might be feet that fitted
into the bottom of the chest and made it easier to move about.
The larger ones were long enough to use for a bed, and in these
the tapestries that covered the walls, the embroidered bed-hangings,
the cushions and mattresses to make hard seats and
couches more comfortable, and the magnificent robes for state
occasions, could be packed for any sort of journey. Huches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
were needed also for silver and gold state dishes, and the
spices, preserved fruits and other luxuries needed for state
feasts. It was desirable to make the chests beautiful as well
as strong, for they were used as furniture; there might be a
state bedstead, a huge wardrobe and one or two other furnishings
in the apartments used by great folk, but the table was a
movable one made of boards on trestles, and the carved huches,
decorated with the heraldic emblems of the owner, served
innumerable purposes. When one sees the specimens that are
left, it does not seem surprising that when kings and queens
went anywhere in the Middle Ages they went, if possible, by
water. Luggage of that kind could be carried more easily by
barge than by wagon.</p>

<p>After the first day, when he finished the small carved figure
of Brother Basil for his master to see, Quentin did almost
anything but carving. He ran errands, he sharpened tools, he
helped a journeyman at his work, he worked on common carpentering
which required no artistic skill. The work which
Master Gerard undertook was not such as an apprentice could
be trusted to do. Quentin, watching as closely as he could all
that was done in the shop, saw that one sort of wood was
chosen for one use, and another kind for a different job; he
saw how a tool was handled to get a free, bold curve or a delicate
fold of drapery, and he found out more about the trade in
a year than most modern carpenters ever learn.</p>

<p>It was hot and uncomfortable in Amiens that summer. Life
inside walls, among houses crowded and tall, was not like
life in a country village, but it was not in Quentin to give up.
When he felt like leaving the noisy, treeless town for the forest
he would try to make a design of the flowers he remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or carve a knotted branch with the tools that he was allowed
to use. He knew that when he should be entrusted with the
carving of a chest, if that time ever came, he would have to
be able to make his own design, if necessary, for that was a
part of the work.</p>

<p>Chests were carved on the lids and ends, which showed when
they were set up, and sometimes they were covered with carving.
Master Gerard had a chest of his own, full of patterns
which he brought out to show his patrons now and then, but
which no one else ever touched. These patterns, however,
were rarely followed exactly. Each great family had its own
heraldic device, and the leopard, the dragon, the dolphin, the
fleur-de-lis, the portcullis, or whatever it might be, must form
an important part of the decoration. Some of the patterns,
while their proportions were perfect, were too simple for the
taste of the one who ordered the chest, and had to be varied.
Some were too elaborate for a small piece of work, and had
to be made simpler. The wood-carver had very little chance
of success unless he was also an artist, as he usually was.</p>

<p>One day a great piece of carving was finished, and Master
Gerard himself went to see that the workmen carried it safely;
it was a chest in the form of a half-circle, for the tapestries and
embroideries of the cathedral, in which the state mantle and
robes of the Bishop could be laid flat with all their heavy
gold-work. The youngest journeyman, Pol, who was left to
mind the shop, slipped out a few minutes later, charging
Quentin strictly to stay until he came back.</p>

<p>Quentin had no objection. He wanted to try a pattern of
his own for a small huche that was finished all but the carving.
He had in mind a pattern of Master Gerard&rsquo;s, a border simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
yet beautiful. It was copied from the inner wall of a Greek
temple, although he did not know that. It was a running vine
with leaves and now and then a flower, not like any vine that
he had ever seen. The inclosed oblong on the lid was divided
into halves by a bar, in the form of a woman&rsquo;s figure. Quentin
thought that that was rather too stately a decoration for a
small chest, and he decided to use a simple rounded bar, with
grooves, which he knew that he could do well.</p>

<p>He was not sure how the border went. Of course, he might
wait until Master Gerard came back and ask to see the pattern,
but he did not quite like to do that. It might seem presuming.
He wondered how it would do to try apricot twigs laid stem
to tip in a curving line, a ripe fruit in place of the flower of
the pattern, and blossom-clusters here and there. He tried it
cautiously, drawing the outline first on a corner, and it looked
so well that he began to carve the twigs.</p>

<p>He was finishing the second when he heard a voice in the
doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Master Gerard do his work with elves? Or have the
fairies taken him and left a changeling?&rdquo; The voice was
musical with laughter, and the boy looked up to see a lovely
and richly-robed lady standing within the door. A little behind
her was a young man in the dress of a troubadour, and
servingmen stood outside holding the bridles of the horses.</p>

<p>Quentin sprang to his feet and bowed respectfully. &ldquo;Master
Gerard is but absent for an hour or two,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;shall I
run to the Cathedral and fetch him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; the lady answered, sinking into the high-backed
chair in the corner, &ldquo;it is cool here, and we will await him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Ranulph, come look at this coffret. I maintain that the fairies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
teach these people to work in wood as they do. Saw you ever
the like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The troubadour bent over the just-begun carving. &ldquo;This is
no boy&rsquo;s play; this is good work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have the
right notion; the eye and the hand work together like two good
comrades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord shall see this when he comes. I like the work.&rdquo;
She touched the cheek of the apricot with a dainty finger.
&ldquo;Where did you get the pattern?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quentin looked down, rather shyly; he did not feel sure
that he would be believed. &ldquo;I had no pattern,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
remembered one that Master Gerard made for a great house
a month since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so do I!&rdquo; laughed the lady. &ldquo;Now I know where I
saw that border. Therefore, not having the copy before
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You invented this variation. Upon my word, the race of
wood-carvers has not come to an end,&rdquo; laughed the young
man. &ldquo;I think that his Royal Highness will like this coffret
well.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;UPON MY WORD, THE RACE OF WOOD-CARVERS HAS NOT
YET COME TO AN END&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>All in a flash it came to Quentin who this was. Some time
before he had heard that the Princess Margaret, daughter of
the French King, was in the city, with her husband, Prince
Henry of England. It was for the Prince that Master Gerard
had made that other chest. Things linked themselves together
in this world, it seemed, like the apricots and blossoms of his
design.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finish the chest,&rdquo; said the Princess after a pause. &ldquo;I will
have it for a traveling casket. Can you carve a head on the
top&mdash;or two heads, facing one another, man and woman?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo; asked Quentin, and he traced an outline on
the bench. It was the lady&rsquo;s beautiful profile.</p>

<p>Master Gerard came in just then, and Pol came slinking in
at the back door. The next day Quentin was promoted to
Pol&rsquo;s place, and finished his chest in great content and happiness.
It was the beginning in a long upward climb to success.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
<br />
AT THE SIGN OF THE GOLD FINCH<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW GUY, THE GOLDSMITH&rsquo;S APPRENTICE, WON THE DESIRE
OF HIS HEART</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Bang</span>&mdash;slam&mdash;bang-bang&mdash;slam! slam! slam!</p>

<p>If anybody on the Chepe in the twelfth century had
ever heard of rifle-practice, early risers thereabouts
might have been reminded of the crackle of guns. The
noise was made by the taking down of shutters all along the
shop fronts, and stacking them together out of the way. The
business day in London still begins in the same way, but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
there are plate-glass windows inside the shutters, and the
shops open between eight and nine instead of soon after day-break.</p>

<p>It was the work of the apprentices and the young sons of
shop-keepers to take down the shutters, sweep the floors, and
put things in order for the business of the day. This was the
task which Guy, nephew of Gamelyn the goldsmith, at the sign
of the Gold Finch, particularly liked. The air blew sweet and
fresh from the convent gardens to the eastward of the city, or
up the river below London Bridge, or down from the forest-clad
hills of the north, and those who had the first draft of
it were in luck. London streets were narrow and twisty-wise,
but not overhung with coal smoke, for the city still burned
wood from the forests without the walls.</p>

<p>On this May morning, Guy was among the first of the boys
who tumbled out from beds behind the counter and began to
open the shops. The shop-fronts were all uninclosed on the
first floor, and when the shutters were down the shop was
separated from the street only by the counter. Above were
the rooms in which the shop-keeper and his family lived, and
the second story often jutted over the one below and made a
kind of covered porch. In some of the larger shops, like this
one of Goldsmiths&rsquo; Row, the jewelers&rsquo; street, there was a third
story which could be used as a storeroom. There were no glass
cases or glass windows. Lattices and shutters were used in
window-openings, and the goods of finer quality were kept in
wooden chests. The shop was also a work-room, for the shopkeeper
was a manufacturer as well, and a part if not all that
he sold was made in his own house.</p>

<p>Guy, having stacked away the shutters and taken a drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of water from the well in the little garden at the rear, got
a broom and began to sweep the stone floor. It was like the
brooms in pictures of witches, a bundle of fresh twigs bound
on the end of a stick, withes of supple young willow being
used instead of cord. Some of the twigs in the broom had
sprouted green leaves. Guy sang as he swept the trash out
into the middle of the street, but as a step came down the
narrow stair he hushed his song. When old Gamelyn had
rheumatism the less noise there was, the better. The five
o&rsquo;clock breakfast, a piece of brown bread, a bit of herring and
a horn cup of ale, was soon finished, and then the goldsmith,
rummaging among his wares, hauled a leather sack out of a
chest and bade Guy run with it to Ely House.</p>

<p>This was an unexpected pleasure, especially for a spring
morning as fair as a blossoming almond tree. The Bishop of
Ely lived outside London Wall, near the road to Oxford, and
his house was like a palace in a fairy-tale. It had a chapel as
stately as an ordinary church, a great banquet-hall, and acres
of gardens and orchards. No pleasanter place could be found
for an errand in May. Guy trotted along in great satisfaction,
making all the speed he could, for the time he saved on the
road he might have to look about in Ely House.</p>

<p>For a city boy, he was extremely fond of country ways.
He liked to walk out on a holiday to Mile End between the
convent gardens; he liked to watch the squirrels flyte and frisk
among the huge trees of Epping Forest; he liked to follow at
the heels of the gardener at Ely House and see what new plant,
shrub or seed some traveler from far lands had brought for the
Bishop. He did not care much for the city houses, even for
the finest ones, unless they had a garden. Privately he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that if ever he had his uncle&rsquo;s shop and became rich,&mdash;and his
uncle had no son of his own,&mdash;he would have a house outside
the wall, with a garden in which he would grow fruits and
vegetables for his table. Another matter on which his mind
was quite made up was the kind of things that would be made
in the shop when he had it. The gold finch that served for a
sign had been made by his grandfather, who came from Limoges,
and it was handsomer than anything that Guy had seen
there in Gamelyn&rsquo;s day. Silver and gold work was often sent
there to be repaired, like the cup he had in the bag, a silver
wine-cup which the Bishop&rsquo;s steward now wanted at once;
but Guy wanted to learn to make such cups, and candlesticks,
and finely wrought banquet-dishes himself.</p>

<p>He gave the cup to the steward and was told to come back
for his money after tierce, that is, after the service at the third
hour of the day, about half way between sunrise and noon.
There were no clocks, and Guy would know when it was time
to go back by the sound of the church bells. The hall was full
of people coming and going on various errands. One was a
tired-looking man in a coarse robe, and broad hat, rope girdle,
and sandals, who, when he was told that the Bishop was at
Westminster on business with the King, looked so disappointed
that Guy felt sorry for him. The boy slipped into the garden
for a talk with his old friend the gardener, who gave him a
head of new lettuce and some young mustard, both of which
were uncommon luxuries in a London household of that day,
and some roots for the tiny walled garden which he and Aunt
Joan were doing their best to keep up. As he came out of the
gate, having got his money, he saw the man he had noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
before sitting by the roadside trying to fasten his sandal. The
string was worn out.</p>

<p>A boy&rsquo;s pocket usually has string in it. Guy found a piece
of leather thong in his pouch and rather shyly held it out.
The man looked up with an odd smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; he said in curious formal English with a lisp
in it. &ldquo;There is courtesy, then, among Londoners? I began to
think none here cared for anything but money, and yet the
finest things in the world are not for sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guy did not know what to answer, but the idea interested
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sky above our heads,&rdquo; the wayfarer went on, looking
with narrowed eyes at the pink may spilling over the gray wall
of the Bishop&rsquo;s garden,&mdash;&ldquo;flowers, birds, music, these are for
all. When you go on pilgrimage you find out how pleasant is
the world when you need not think of gain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger was a pilgrim, then. That accounted for the
clothes, but old Gamelyn had been on pilgrimage to the new
shrine at Canterbury, and it had not helped his rheumatism
much, and certainly had given him no such ideas as these.
Guy looked up at the weary face with the brilliant eyes and
smile,&mdash;they were walking together now,&mdash;and wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you in London?&rdquo; the pilgrim asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle is a goldsmith in Chepe,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you going to be a goldsmith in Chepe too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you like not the plan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guy hesitated. He never had talked of his feeling about
the business, but he felt that this man would see what he
meant. &ldquo;I should like it better than anything,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
we made things like those the Bishop has. Uncle Gamelyn
says that there is no profit in them, because they take the finest
metal and the time of the best workmen, and the pay is no
more, and folk do not want them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said the pilgrim earnestly, &ldquo;there are always
folk who want the best. There are always men who will
make only the best, and when the two come together&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He clapped his hollowed palms like a pair of cymbals.
&ldquo;Would you like to make a dish as blue as the sea, with figures
of the saints in gold work and jewel-work&mdash;a gold cup garlanded
in flowers all done in their own color,&mdash;a shrine threefold,
framing pictures of the saints and studded with orfrey-work
of gold and gems, yet so beautiful in the mere work that
no one would think of the jewels? Would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would I!&rdquo; said Guy with a deep quick breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our jewelers of Limoges make all these, and when kings
and their armies come from the Crusades they buy of us thank-offerings,&mdash;candlesticks,
altar-screens, caskets, chalices, gold
and silver and enamel-work of every kind. We sit at the
cross-roads of Christendom. The jewels come to us from the
mines of East and West. Men come to us with full purses and
glad hearts, desiring to give to the Church costly gifts of their
treasure, and our best work is none too good for their desire.
But here we are at Saint Paul&rsquo;s. I shall see you again, for I
have business on the Chepe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guy headed for home as eagerly as a marmot in harvest
time, threading his way through the crowds of the narrow
streets without seeing them. He could not imagine who the
stranger might be. It was dinner time, and he had to go to
the cook-shop and bring home the roast, for families who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
afford it patronized the cook-shops on the Thames instead of
roasting and baking at home in the narrow quarters of the
shops. In the great houses, with their army of servants and
roomy kitchens, it was different; and the very poor did what
they could, as they do everywhere; but when the wife and
daughters of the shopkeeper served in the shop, or worked at
embroidery, needle-craft, weaving, or any light work of the
trade that they could do, it was an economy to have the cooking
done out of the house.</p>

<p>When the shadows were growing long and the narrow pavement
of Goldsmith&rsquo;s Row was quite dark, someone wearing a
gray robe and a broad hat came along the street, slowly, glancing
into each shop as he passed. To Guy&rsquo;s amazement, old
Gamelyn got to his feet and came forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it thou indeed, master?&rdquo; he said, bowing again
and again. The pilgrim smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine shop you have here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a fine young bird
in training for the sign of the Gold Finch. He and I scraped
acquaintance this morning. Is he the youth of whom you told
me when we met at Canterbury?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hard on Guy that just at that moment his aunt Joan
called him to get some water from the well, but he went, all
bursting with eagerness as he was. The pilgrim stayed to
supper, and in course of time Guy found out what he had
come for.</p>

<p>He was Eloy, one of the chief jewelers of Limoges, which
in the Middle Ages meant that his work was known in every
country of Europe, for that city had been as famous for its
gold work ever since the days of Clovis as it is now for porcelain.
Enamel-work was done there as well, and the cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
workmen knew how to decorate gold, silver, or copper in colors
like vivid flame, living green, the blue of summer skies. Eloy
offered to take Guy as an apprentice and teach him all that he
could for the sake of the maker of the Gold Finch, who had
been his own good friend and master. It was as if the head
of one of the great Paris studios should offer free training for
the next ten years to some penniless art student of a country
town.</p>

<p>What amazed Guy more than anything else, however, was
the discovery that his grumbling old uncle, who never had had
a good word to say for him in the shop, had told this great
artist about him when they met five years before, and begged
Eloy if ever he came to London to visit the Gold Finch and see
the little fellow who was growing up there to learn the ancient
craft in a town where men hardly knew what good work was.
Even now old Gamelyn would only say that his nephew was
a good boy and willing, but so painstaking that he would never
make a tradesman; he spent so much unnecessary time on his
work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may be an artist,&rdquo; said Eloy with a smile; and some
specimens of the work which Guy did when he was a man,
which are now carefully kept in museums, prove that he was.
No one knows how the enamel-work of Limoges was done; it
is only clear that the men who did it were artists. The secret
has long been lost&mdash;ever since the city, centuries ago, was
trampled under the feet of war.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
<br />
THE VENTURE OF NICHOLAS GAY<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW NICHOLAS GAY, THE MERCHANT&rsquo;S SON, KEPT FAITH
WITH A STRANGER AND SERVED THE KING</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Nicholas Gay</span> stood on the wharf by his father&rsquo;s
warehouse, and the fresh morning breeze that blew up
from the Pool of the Thames was ruffling his bright
hair. He could hear the seamen chanting at the windlass,
and the shouts of the boatmen threading their skiffs and
scows in and out among the crowded shipping. There were
high-pooped Flemish freighters, built to hold all the cargo
possible for a brief voyage; English coasting ships, lighter and
quicker in the chop of the Channel waves; larger and more
dignified London merchantmen, that had the best oak of the
Weald in their bones and the pick of the Southdown wool to
fill them full; Mediterranean galleys that shipped five times
the crew and five times the cargo of a London ship; weather-beaten
traders that had come over the North Sea with cargoes
of salt fish; and many others.</p>

<p>The scene was never twice the same, and the boy never
tired of it. Coming into port with a cargo of spices and wine
was a long Mediterranean galley with oars as well as sails,
each oar pulled by a slave who kept time with his neighbor
like a machine. The English made their bid for fortune with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the sailing-ship, and even in the twelfth century, when their
keels were rarely seen in any Eastern port, there was little of
the rule of wind and sea short of Gibraltar that their captains
did not know.</p>

<p>Up Mart Lane, the steep little street from the wharves,
Nicholas heard some one singing a familiar chantey, but not
as the sailors sang it. He was a slender youth with a laugh in
his eye, and he was singing to a guitar-like lute. He was
piecing out the chantey and fitting words to it, and succeeding
rather well. Nicholas stood by his father&rsquo;s warehouse, hands
behind him and eyes on the ship just edging out to catch the
tide, and listened to the song, his heart full of dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, there, youngster!&rdquo; said the singer kindly as he
reached the end of the strophe. &ldquo;Have you a share in that
ship that you watch her so sharply?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Nicholas gravely, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not one of father&rsquo;s
ships. She&rsquo;s the <cite>Heath Hen</cite> of Weymouth, and she&rsquo;s loaded
with wool, surely, but she&rsquo;s for Bordeaux.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless the urchin, he might have been born on board!&rdquo; The
young man looked at Nicholas rather more attentively. &ldquo;Your
father has ships, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded proudly. &ldquo;The <cite>Rose-in-June</cite>, and the
<cite>Sainte Spirite</cite>, and the <cite>Thomasyn</cite>,&mdash;she&rsquo;s named for mother,&mdash;and
the <cite>Sainte Genevieve</cite>, because father was born in Paris,
you know, and the <cite>Saint Nicholas</cite>,&mdash;that&rsquo;s named for me.
But I&rsquo;m not old enough to have a venture yet. Father says I
shall some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Pool of the Thames was crowded, and as the wind
freshened the ships looked even more like huge white-winged
birds. Around them sailed and wheeled and fluttered the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sea-birds, picking up their living from the scraps thrown overboard,&mdash;swans,
gulls, wild geese and ducks, here and there
a strange bird lured to the harbor by hope of spoil. The oddly
mated companions, the man and the boy, walked along busy
Thames Street and came to Tower Hill and the great gray
fortress-towers, with a double line of wall coiled around the
base, just outside the City of London. The deep wide moat
fed from the river made an island for the group of buildings
with the square White Tower in the middle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your friends live there, I suppose?&rdquo; the young
man inquired, and Nicholas smiled rather dubiously, for he
was not certain whether it was a joke or not. The Tower had
been prison, palace and fort by turns, but common criminals
were not imprisoned there&mdash;only those who had been accused
of crimes against the State. &ldquo;Lucky you,&rdquo; the youth added.
&ldquo;London is much pleasanter as a residence, I assure you. I
lodged not far from here when I first came, but now I
lodge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That sentence was never finished. Clattering down Tower
Hill came a troop of horse, and one, swerving suddenly, caught
Nicholas between his heels and the wall, and by the time the
rider had his animal under control the little fellow was lying
senseless in the arms of the stranger, who had dived in among
the flying hoofs and dragged him clear. The rider, lagging
behind the rest, looked hard at the two, and then spurred on
without even stopping to ask whether he had hurt the boy.</p>

<p>Before Nicholas had fairly come to himself he shut his
teeth hard to keep from crying out with the pain in his side
and left leg. The young man had laid him carefully down
close by the wall, and just as he was looking about for help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
three of the troopers came spurring back, dismounted, and
pressed close around the youth as one of them said something
in French. He straightened up and looked at them, and in
spite of his pain Nicholas could not help noticing that he
looked proudly and straightforwardly, as if he were a gentleman
born. He answered them in the same language; they
shook their heads and made gruff, short answers. The young
man laid his hand on his dagger, hesitated, and turned back
to Nicholas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little lad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is indeed bad fortune. They will
not let me take you home, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; So deftly that the action
was hidden from the men who stood by, he closed Nicholas&rsquo;
hand over a small packet, while apparently he was only searching
for a coin in his pouch and beckoning to a respectable-looking
market-woman who halted near by just then. He
added in a quick low tone without looking at the boy, &ldquo;Keep it
for me and say nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded and slipped the packet into the breast of
his doublet, with a groan which was very real, for it hurt him
to move that arm. The young man rose and as his captors
laid heavy hands upon him he put some silver in the woman&rsquo;s
hand, saying persuasively, &ldquo;This boy has been badly hurt. I
know not who he is, but see that he gets home safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, master,&rdquo; said the woman compassionately, and then
everything grew black once more before Nicholas&rsquo; eyes as he
tried to see where the men were going. When he came to himself
they were gone, and he told the woman that he was Nicholas
Gay and that his father was Gilbert Gay, in Fenchurch
Street. The woman knew the house, which was tile-roofed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
three-storied, and had a garden; she called a porter and sent
him for a hurdle, and they got Nicholas home.</p>

<p>The merchant and his wife were seriously disturbed over the
accident,&mdash;not only because the boy was hurt, and hurt in so
cruel a way, but because some political plot or other seemed
to be mixed up in it. From what the market-woman said it
looked as if the men might have been officers of the law, and
it was her guess that the young man was an Italian spy.
Whatever he was, he had been taken in at the gates of the
Tower. In a city of less than fifty thousand people, all sorts
of gossip is rife about one faction and another, and if Gilbert
Gay came to be suspected by any of the King&rsquo;s advisers there
were plenty of jealous folk ready to make trouble for him and
his. Time went by, however, and they heard nothing more
of it.</p>

<p>Nicholas said nothing, even to his mother, of the packet
which he had hidden under the straw of his bed. It was
sealed with a splash of red wax over the silken knot that tied it,
and much as he desired to know what was inside, Nicholas
had been told by his father that a seal must never be broken
except by the person who had a right to break it. Gilbert Gay
had also told his children repeatedly that if anything was
given to them, or told them, in confidence, it was most wrong
to say a word about it. It never occurred to Nicholas that
perhaps his father would expect him to tell of this. The
youth had told him not to tell, and he must not tell, and that
was all about it.</p>

<p>The broken rib and the bruises healed in time, and by the
season when the <cite>Rose-in-June</cite> was due to sail, Nicholas was
able to limp into the rose-garden and play with his little sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Genevieve at sailing rose-petal boats in the fountain. The
time of loading the ships for a foreign voyage was always
rather exciting, and this was the best and fastest of them all.
When she came back, if the voyage had been fortunate, she
would be laden with spices and perfumes, fine silks and linen,
from countries beyond the sunrise where no one that Nicholas
knew had ever been. From India and Persia, Arabia and Turkey,
caravans of laden camels were even then bringing her
cargo across the desert. They would be unloaded in such
great market-places as Moussoul, Damascus, Bagdad and
Cairo, the Babylon of those days. Alexandria and Constantinople,
Tyre and Joppa, were seaport market-cities, and here
the Venetian and Genoese galleys, or French ships of Marseilles
and Bordeaux, or the half-Saracen, half-Norman traders
of Messina came for their goods.</p>

<p>The <cite>Rose-in-June</cite> would touch at Antwerp and unload wool
for Flemish weavers to make into fine cloth; she would cruise
around the coast, put in at Bordeaux, and sell the rest of her
wool, and the grain of which England also had a plenty. She
might go on to Cadiz, or even through the Straits of Gibraltar
to Marseilles and Messina. The more costly the stuff which
she could pack into the hold for the homeward voyage, the
greater the profit for all concerned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Since wool takes up far more room in proportion to its value
than silk, wine or spices, money as well as merchandise must
be put into the venture, and the more money, the more profit.
Others joined in the venture with Master Gay. Edrupt the
wool-merchant furnished a part of the cargo on his own account;
wool-merchants traveled through the country as agents
for Master Gay. The men who served in the warehouse put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in their share; even the porters and apprentices sent something,
if no more than a shilling. There was some profit also
in the passenger trade, especially in time of pilgrimage when
it was hard to get ships enough for all who wished to go. The
night before the sailing, Nicholas escaped from the happy
hubbub and went slowly down to the wharves. It was not a
very long walk, but it tired him, and he felt rather sad as he
looked at the grim gray Tower looming above the river, and
wondered if the owner of the packet sealed with the red seal
would ever come back.</p>

<p>As he passed the little church at the foot of Tower Hill a
light step came up behind him, and two hands were placed on
his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My faith!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Have you been here all
this time?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill07" id="ill07"></a>
<a href="images/ill07h.png"><img src="images/ill07.png" width="400" height="546" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL THIS TIME?&rsquo;&rdquo;" title="Click for larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL THIS TIME?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>He was thinner and paler, but the laughter still sparkled in
his dark eyes, and he was dressed in daintily embroidered
doublet, fine hose, and cloak of the newest fashion, a gold
chain about his neck and a harp slung from his shoulder. A
group of well-dressed servants stood near the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m well now,&rdquo; said Nicholas rather shyly but happily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you have come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at my wit&rsquo;s end when I thought of you, lad,&rdquo; went
on the other, &ldquo;for I remembered too late that neither of us
knew the other&rsquo;s name, and if I had told mine or asked yours
in the hearing of a certain rascal it might have been a sorry
time for us both. They made a little mistake, you see,&mdash;they
took me for a traitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could they?&rdquo; said Nicholas, surprised and indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, black is white to a scared man&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; said his companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
light-heartedly. &ldquo;How have your father&rsquo;s ships prospered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of them,&rdquo;&mdash;Nicholas pointed, proudly, across
the little space of water, to the <cite>Rose-in-June</cite> tugging at her
anchor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fine ship,&rdquo; the young man said consideringly, and
then, as he saw the parcel Nicholas was taking from his bosom,
&ldquo;Do you mean to say that that has never been opened? What
sort of folk are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never told,&rdquo; said Nicholas, somewhat bewildered. &ldquo;You
said I was not to speak of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there was no name on it, for a certain reason.&rdquo; The
young man balanced the parcel in his hand and whistled softly.
&ldquo;You see, I was expecting to meet hereabouts a certain pilgrim
who was to take the parcel to Bordeaux,&mdash;and beyond. I was&mdash;interfered
with, as you know, and now it must go by a safe
hand to one who will deliver it to this same pilgrim. I should
say that your father must know how to choose his captains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father is Master Gilbert Gay,&rdquo;&mdash;Nicholas held his
head very straight&mdash;&ldquo;and that is Master Garland, the captain
of the <cite>Rose-in-June</cite>, coming ashore now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know him. I have had dealings with him before
now. How would it be&mdash;since without your good help this
packet would almost certainly have been lost&mdash;to let the worth
of it be your venture in the cargo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My venture?&rdquo; Nicholas stammered, the color rising in his
cheeks. &ldquo;My venture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not worth much in money,&rdquo; the troubadour said with
a queer little laugh, &ldquo;but it is something. Master Garland, I
see you have not forgotten me,&mdash;Ranulph, called le Provençal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Here is a packet to be delivered to Tomaso the physician of
Padua, whom you know. The money within is this young
man&rsquo;s share in your cargo, and Tomaso will pay you for your
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Garland grinned broadly in his big beard. &ldquo;Surely,
sure-ly,&rdquo; he chuckled, and pocketed the parcel as if it had been
an apple, but Nicholas noted that he kept his hand on his
pouch as he went on to the wharf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Ranulph said, as there was a stir in the crowd
by the church door,&mdash;evidently some one was coming out. &ldquo;I
must leave you, my lad. Some day we shall meet again.&rdquo;
Then he went hastily away to join a brilliant company of
courtiers in traveling attire. Things were evidently going
well with Ranulph.</p>

<p>Nicholas thought a great deal about that packet in the days
that followed. He took to experimenting with various things
to see what could account for the weight. Lead was heavy,
but no one would send a lump of lead of that size over seas.
The same could be said of iron. He bethought him finally of
a goldsmith&rsquo;s nephew with whom he had acquaintance. Guy
Bouverel was older, but the two boys knew each other well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guy,&rdquo; he said one day, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the heaviest metal you
ever handled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; said Guy promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bag that was too heavy to have silver in it would have
gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think so. Have you found treasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Nicholas, &ldquo;I was wondering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <cite>Rose-in-June</cite> came back before she was due. Master
Garland came up to the house with Gilbert Gay, one rainy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
evening when Nicholas and Genevieve were playing nine-men&rsquo;s-morris
in a corner and their mother was embroidering
a girdle by the light of a bracket lamp. Nicholas had been
taught not to interrupt, and he did not, but he was glad when
his mother said gently, but with shining eyes, &ldquo;Nicholas, come
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a queer story that Captain Garland had to tell, and
nobody could make out exactly what it meant. Two or three
years before he had met Ranulph, who was then a troubadour
in the service of Prince Henry of Anjou, and he had taken a
casket of gold pieces to Tomaso the physician, who was then
in Genoa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do say,&rdquo; said Captain Garland, pulling at his russet
beard, &ldquo;that the old doctor can do anything short o&rsquo; raising the
dead. They fair worshiped him there, I know. But it&rsquo;s my
notion that that box o&rsquo; gold pieces wasn&rsquo;t payment for physic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; said the merchant smiling. &ldquo;Secret messengers
are more likely to deliver their messages if no one
knows they have any. But what happened this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the sea captain, &ldquo;I found the old doctor in
his garden, with a great cat o&rsquo; Malta stalking along beside
him, and I gave him the packet. He opened it and read the
letter, and then he untied a little leather purse and spilled out
half a dozen gold pieces and some jewels that fair made me
blink&mdash;not many, but beauties&mdash;rubies and emeralds and
pearls. He beckoned toward the house and a man in pilgrim&rsquo;s
garb came out and valued the jewels. Then he sent me back
to the <cite>Rose-in-June</cite> with the worth o&rsquo; the jewels in coined gold
and this ring here. &lsquo;Tell the boy,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that he saved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
King&rsquo;s jewels, and that he has a better jewel than all of them,
the jewel of honor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; said Nicholas, rather puzzled, &ldquo;what else
could I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of them could make anything of the mystery, but as
Tomaso of Padua talked with Eloy the goldsmith that same
evening they agreed that the price they paid was cheap. In
the game the Pope&rsquo;s party was playing against that of the Emperor
for the mastery of Europe, it had been deemed advisable
to find out whether Henry Plantagenet would rule the Holy
Roman Empire if he could. He had refused the offer of the
throne of the Cæsars, and it was of the utmost importance that
no one should know that the offer had been made. Hence the
delivery of the letter to the jeweler.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
<br />
BARBARA, THE LITTLE GOOSE-GIRL<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW BARBARA SOLD GEESE IN THE CHEPE AND WHAT FORTUNE
SHE FOUND THERE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Any</span> one who had happened to be traveling along the
Islington Road between two and three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, when London was a walled city, would have
seen how London was to be fed that day. But very
few were on the road at that hour except the people whose
business it was to feed London, and to them it was an old
story. There were men with cattle and men with sheep and
men with pigs; there were men with little, sober, gray donkeys,
not much bigger than a large dog, trotting all so briskly along
with the deep baskets known as paniers hung on each side
their backs; men with paniers or huge sacks on their own backs,
partly resting on the shoulders and partly held by a leather
strap around the forehead; men with flat, shallow baskets on
their heads, piled three and four deep and filled with vegetables.
That was the way in which all the butter, fruit, poultry,
eggs, meat, and milk for Londoners to eat came into
medieval London. Before London Wall was fairly finished
there were laws against any one within the city keeping cattle
or pigs on the premises. Early every morning the market folk
started from the villages round about,&mdash;there were women as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
well as men in the business&mdash;and by the time the city gates
opened they were there.</p>

<p>It was not as exciting to Barbara Thwaite as it would have
been if she had not known every inch of the road, but it was
exciting enough on this particular summer morning, for in all
her thirteen years she had never been to market alone. Goody
Thwaite had been trudging over the road several times a week
for years&mdash;seven miles to London and seven miles home&mdash;and
sometimes she had taken Barbara with her, but never had she
sent the child by herself. Now she was bedridden and unless
they were to lose all their work for the last month or more,
Barbara would have to go to market and tend their stall.
Several of the neighbors had stalls near by, and they would
look after the child, but this was the busy season, and they
could not undertake to carry any produce but their own. A
neighbor, too old to do out-of-door work, would tend the
mother, and with much misgiving and many cautions, consent
was given, and Barbara set bravely forth alone.</p>

<p>She had her hands full in more senses than one. Besides
the basket she carried on her head, full of cress from the brook,
sallet herbs and under these some early cherries, she had a
basket of eggs on her arm, and she was driving three geese.
Barbara&rsquo;s geese were trained to walk in the most orderly single
file at home, but she had her doubts as to their behavior in a
strange place.</p>

<p>The Islington Road, however, was not the broad and dusty
highway that it is to-day, and at first it was not very crowded.
Now and again, from one of the little wooded lanes that led
up to farmsteads, a marketman would turn into the highway
with his load, and more and more of them appeared as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
neared the city, so that by the time they reached the city gate
it was really a dense throng. From roads in every direction
just such crowds were pressing toward all the other gates, and
boats laden with green stuff, fruits, butter and cheese were
heading for the wharves on Thames-side, all bound for the
market.</p>

<p>Naturally it had been discovered long before that some sort
of order would have to be observed, or there would be a frightful
state of things among the eatables. Like most cities, London
was inhabited largely by people who had come from
smaller towns, and certain customs were common more or less
to every market-town in England. In the smaller towns the
cattle-market was held weekly or fortnightly, so that people
not anxious to deal in cattle could avoid the trampling herds.
London&rsquo;s cattle-market was not in the Chepe at all. It was in
the fields outside the walls, in the deep inbent angle which the
wall made between Aldersgate and Newgate, where Smithfield
market is now. Even in the Chepe each kind of goods had its
own place, and once through the gates the crowd separated.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill08" id="ill08"></a>
<a href="images/ill08h.jpg"><img src="images/ill08.jpg" width="400" height="588" alt="&ldquo;BARBARA KNEW EXACTLY WHERE TO GO&rdquo;&mdash;Page&nbsp;97" title="Click for larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;BARBARA KNEW EXACTLY WHERE TO GO&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Page&nbsp;97</i></span>
</div>

<p>Barbara knew exactly where to go. From Aldersgate she
turned to the left and followed the narrow streets toward the
spire of St. Michael&rsquo;s Church in Cornhill, where the poultry-dealers
had their stands. Close by was Scalding Alley, sometimes
known as the Poultry, where poultry were sold by the
score, and the fowls were scalded after being killed, to make
them ready for cooking. Goody Thwaite&rsquo;s little corner,
wedged in between two bigger stalls, was not much more than
a board with a coarse awning over it, but she had been there a
long time and her neighbors were friends. Barbara set down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
her loads, dropped on the bench and scattered a little grain for
her geese. They had really behaved very well.</p>

<p>She was not very much to look at, this little lass Barbara.
Her grandfather had come from the North Country, and she
had black hair and eyes like a gypsy. She was rather silent
as a rule, though she could sing like a blackbird when no one
was about. People were likely to forget about Barbara until
they wanted something done; then they remembered her.</p>

<p>She penned in the geese with a small hurdle of wicker so
that they should not get away; she set out the cherries and
cress on one side and the eggs on the other; then she put the
eggs in a bed of cress to set off their whiteness; then she waited.
An apprentice boy came by and asked the price of the cherries,
whistled and went on; a sharp-faced woman stopped and
looked over what she had, and went on. They were all in a
hurry; they were all going on some errand of their own. The
next person who came by was an old woman with a fresh
bright face, white cap and neat homespun gown. She too
asked the price of the cherries and shook her head when she
heard it. &ldquo;How good that cress looks!&rdquo; she said smiling.</p>

<p>Barbara held out a bunch of the cress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give away the cherries,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they are not
mine, but you&rsquo;re welcome to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly, little maid,&rdquo; the old woman said, &ldquo;my
grandson&rsquo;s o&rsquo;er fond of it. Never was such a chap for sallets
and the like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later a stout, rather fussy man stopped and
bought the whole basket of eggs. As he paid for them and
signed to the boy who followed to take them, Michael the
poultryman in the next stall grinned at Barbara.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t know who that was, do you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
was old Gamelyn Bouverel the goldsmith. You&rsquo;ll be sorry
if any of those eggs be addled, my maiden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;I know where all our hens&rsquo;
nests are, and Gaffer Edmunds&rsquo; too. We sell for him since
he had the palsy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a tall man in a sort of uniform stopped, eyed the staff,
and without asking leave took one of the geese from the pen
and strode off with it hissing and squawking under his arm.
But Michael shook his head soberly as Barbara sprang up with
a startled face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was one o&rsquo; the purveyors of my lord Fitz-Walter,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;He may pay for the bird and he may not, but you
can&rsquo;t refuse him. There&rsquo;s one good thing&mdash;London folk don&rsquo;t
have to feed the King&rsquo;s soldiers nor his household. Old King
Henry,&mdash;rest his soul!&mdash;settled that in the Charter he gave
the City, and this one has kept to it. My grand-dad used to
tell how any time you might have a great roaring archer or
man-at-arms, or more likely two or three or a dozen, quartered
in your house, willy nilly, for nobody knew how long. There
goes the bell for Prime&mdash;that ends the privilege.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Barbara remembered that the stewards of great houses
were allowed to visit the market and choose what they wished
until Prime (about six o&rsquo;clock) after which the market was
open to common folk. A merchant&rsquo;s wife bought another goose
and some cherries, and the remaining goose was taken off her
hands by the good-natured Michael, to make up a load of his
own for a tavern-keeper. The rest of the cherries were sold to
a young man who was very particular about the way in which
they were arranged in the basket, and Barbara guessed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
he was going to take them as a present to some one. The
cress had gone a handful at a time with the other things, and
she had some of it for her own dinner, with bread from the
bakeshop and some cold meat which Goody Collins, her neighbor
on the other side, had sent for. She started for home in
good time, and brought her little store of money to her mother
before any one had even begun to worry over her absence.</p>

<p>The next market-day Barbara set forth with a light heart,
but when she reached her stall she found it occupied. A
rough lout had set up shop there, with dressed poultry for
sale. A-plenty had been said about it before Barbara arrived,
both by Michael and the rough-tongued, kind-hearted market-women.
But Michael was old and fat, and no match for the
invader. Barbara stood in dismay, a great basket of red roses
on her head, her egg-basket on the ground, and the cherries
from their finest tree in a panier hung from her shoulder. The
merchant&rsquo;s wife had asked her if she could not bring some
roses for rose-water and conserve, and if she had to hawk
them about in the sun they would be fit for nothing. The
Poultry was crowded, and unless she could have her little foothold
here she would be obliged to go about the streets peddling,
which she knew her mother would not like at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble here?&rdquo; asked a decided voice behind
her. She turned to look up into the cool gray eyes of a masterful
young fellow with a little old woman tucked under his arm.
He was brown and lithe and had an air of outdoor freshness,
and suddenly she recognized the old woman. It was that first
customer, and this must be the grandson of whom she had
spoken so fondly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man says he has this place and means to keep it,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Barbara explained in a troubled but firm little voice. &ldquo;He
says that only the poultry dealers have any right here,&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo;s corner and she has had it a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, that she has,&rdquo; chorused two or three voices. &ldquo;And if
there was a man belonging to them you&rsquo;d see yon scamp go
packing, like a cat out o&rsquo; the dairy. &rsquo;Tis a downright shame,
so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe a man that don&rsquo;t belong to them will do as well,&rdquo;
said the youth coolly. &ldquo;Back here, gammer, out of the way&mdash;and
you go stand by her, little maid. Now then, you lummox,
are you going to pick up your goods and go, or do I have to
throw them after you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surly fellow eyed the new-comer&rsquo;s broad shoulders and
hard-muscled arms for a moment, picked up his poultry and
began to move, but as he loaded his donkeys he said something
under his breath which Barbara did not hear. An instant later
she beheld him lying on his back in a none-too-clean gutter
with her defender standing over him. He lost no time in making
his way out of the street, followed by the laughter of the
Poultry. Even the ducks, geese and chickens joined in the
cackle of merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit thee down and rest,&rdquo; said the youth to Barbara kindly.
&ldquo;We must be getting on, grandmother. If he makes any more
trouble, send some one, or come yourself, to our lodging&mdash;ask
for Robert Edrupt at the house of Master Hardel the wool-merchant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Barbara shyly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty cress
in the brook, and I&rsquo;ll bring some next market-day&mdash;and strawberries
too, but not for pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindness breeds kindness, little maid,&rdquo; added the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
woman, and Barbara reflected that it sometimes breeds good
fortune also.</p>

<p>This was not the end of Barbara&rsquo;s acquaintance with Dame
Lysbeth and her grandson. The old dame had taken a fancy
to the self-possessed, quaintly dignified little maid, and the
Thwaite garden proved to have in it many fruits and herbs
which she needed in her housekeeping. It was a very old-fashioned
garden planted a long time ago by a tavern-keeper
from the south of France, and he had brought some pears and
plums from his old home in the south and grafted and planted
and tended them very carefully. There was one tree which
had two kinds of pears on it, one for the north side and one
for the south.</p>

<p>Barbara&rsquo;s mother did not get any better. One day Robert
Edrupt stopped in the Poultry to buy a goose for dinner, to
celebrate his home-coming from a long wool-buying journey,
and the stall was empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Goody Collins, wiping her eyes, &ldquo;she was a
good-hearted woman, was Alison Thwaite, and there&rsquo;s many
who will miss her. She died two days ago, rest her soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edrupt bought his goose of Michael and went on his way
looking sober. A plan had occurred to him, and when he
talked it over with Dame Lysbeth she heartily agreed. A day
or two later Barbara, standing in the door of the little lonely
cottage and wondering what she should do now, saw the two
of them coming down the lane. Dame Lysbeth opened the
gate and came in, but Robert, after a bow and a pleasant word
or two to Barbara, went on to the next farm on an errand.</p>

<p>Barbara could hardly believe her ears when she heard what
the old dame had to say. The young wool-merchant had
brought his grandmother to London to keep house for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
because he did not like to leave her alone in her cottage in
the west country, nor could he live there so far from the
great markets. But neither of them liked the city, and for
the next few years he would have to be away more than ever.
He and Master Gay had been considering a scheme for importing
foreign sheep to see if they would improve the quality
of English wool. Before they did this Edrupt would have
to go to Spain, to Aquitaine, to Lombardy and perhaps even
further. While he was abroad he might well study the ways
of the weavers as well as the sheep that grew the fleece. He
wanted to buy a farm he had seen, with a tidy house on it,
where Dame Lysbeth could have the sort of home she was
used to, but with maids to do the heavy farm work. If
Barbara would come and live there, and help see to things, she
would be very welcome indeed as long as she chose to stay.</p>

<p>Dame Lysbeth had never had a daughter, and she had
often thought in the last few months that if she had one, she
would like to have just such a girl as Barbara. The young
girl, on her side, already loved her old friend better than
she had ever loved anybody but her own mother, and so it
came about that when the spring turned the apple orchards
white about King&rsquo;s Barton, three very happy people went
from London to the farm near that village, known as the Long
Lea. It had land about it which was not good enough for
corn, but would do very well for geese and for sheep, and
there was room for a large garden, as well as the orchard.
Even in those early days, people who bought an English
farm usually inherited some of the work of the previous
owner, and as Robert said, they would try to farm Long Lea
in such a way as to leave it richer than they found it, and
still lose no profit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to take cuttings from this garden, lass,&rdquo;
he said to Barbara in his blunt, kindly way, as they stood
there together for the last time. &ldquo;There are things here which
we can make thrive in the years to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Barbara staidly. She motioned to a carefully
packed and tied parcel in a sack. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a whole
basket of eggs from all our fowls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edrupt laughed. He liked her business-like little way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you take any red-rose cuttings?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a still-room where the old castle used to be, and they&rsquo;d use
some, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Provence rose,&rdquo; Barbara said. &ldquo;I took the whole
bush up and set it in a wooden bucket. Michael won&rsquo;t want
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael the poultryman was adding the little garden and
the stall in the Poultry to his own business. He would cart
away the little tumbledown cottage and plant kale there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Provence rose, is it?&rdquo; queried Edrupt thoughtfully.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have it beside our door, Barbara, and that will make
you feel more at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Barbara and the roses throve by transplanting. When
Edrupt came home from his long foreign journey, more than
a year later, it was rose-time, and Barbara, with a basket
of roses on her arm, was marshaling a flock of most important
mother-ducks with their ducklings into the poultry-yard. The
house with its tiled and thatched roofs sat in the middle of its
flocks and fruits and seemed to welcome all who came, and
Dame Lysbeth, beaming from the window, looked so well
content that it did him good to see her.</p>

<h2>IX<br />
<br />
RICHARD&rsquo;S SILVER PENNY<br />
<br />
<span class="rp">HOW RICHARD SOLD A WEB OF RUSSET AND MADE
THE BEST OF A BAD BARGAIN</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Richard</span> was going to market. He was rather a
small boy to be going on that errand, especially as he
carried on his shoulder a bundle nearly as big as he
was. But his mother, with whom he lived in a little,
whitewashed timber-and-plaster hut at the edge of the common,
was too ill to go, and the Cloth Fair was not likely
to wait until she was well again.</p>

<p>The boy could hardly remember his father. Sebastian
Garland was a sailor, and had gone away so long ago that
there was little hope that he would ever come back. Ever
since Richard could remember they had lived as they did
now, mainly by his mother&rsquo;s weaving. They had a few sheep
which were pastured on the common, and one of the neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
helped them with the washing and shearing. The wool
had to be combed and sorted and washed in long and tedious
ways before it was ready to spin, and before it was woven
it was dyed in colors that Dame Garland made from plants
she found in the woods and fields. She had been a Highland
Scotch girl, and could weave tyrtaine, as the people in the
towns called the plaids. None of the English people knew
anything about the different tartans that belonged to the
Scottish clans, but a woman who could weave those could
make woolen cloth of a very pretty variety of patterns. She
worked as a dyer, too, when she could find any one who
would pay for the work, and sometimes she did weaving for
a farm-wife who had more than her maids could do.</p>

<p>Richard knew every step of the work, from sheep-fleece
to loom, and wherever a boy could help, he had been useful.
He had gone to get elder bark, which, with iron filings, would
dye black; he had seen oak bark used to dye yellow, and he
knew that madder root was used for red, and woad for blue.
His mother could not afford to buy the turmeric, indigo,
kermes, and other dyestuffs brought from far countries or
grown in gardens. She had to depend on whatever could be
got for nothing. The bright rich colors which dyers used
in dyeing wool for the London market were not for her. Yellow,
brown, some kinds of green, black, gray and dull red
she could make of common plants, mosses and the bark of trees.
The more costly dyestuffs were made from plants which
did not grow wild in England, or from minerals.</p>

<p>Richard was thinking about all this as he trudged along
the lane, and thinking also that it would be much easier
for them to get a living if it were not for the rules of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Weavers&rsquo; Guild. This association was one of the most important
of the English guilds of the twelfth century, and
had a charter, or protecting permit, from the King, which
gave them special rights and privileges. He had also established
the Cloth Fair at Smithfield in London, the greatest
of all the cloth-markets that were so called. If any man
did the guild &ldquo;any unright or dis-ease&rdquo; there was a fine of
ten pounds, which would mean then more than fifty dollars
would to-day. Later he protected the weavers still further
by ordaining that the Portgrave should burn any cloth which
had Spanish wool mixed with the English, and the weavers
themselves allowed no work by candle-light. This helped to
keep up the standard of the weaving, and to prevent dishonest
dealers from lowering the price by selling inferior
cloth. As early as 1100 Thomas Cole, the rich cloth worker
of Reading, whose wains crowded the highway to London,
had secured a charter from Henry&nbsp;I., this King&rsquo;s grandfather,
and the measure of the King&rsquo;s own arm had been taken for
the standard ell-measure throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>Richard knew all this, because, having no one else to talk
to, his mother had talked much with him; and the laws of
Scotland and England differed in so many ways that she had
had to find out exactly what she might and might not do.
In some of the towns the weavers&rsquo; guilds had made a rule
that no one within ten miles who did not belong to the guild
or did not own sheep should make dyed cloth. This was
profitable to the weavers in the association, but it was rather
hard on those who were outside, and not every one was allowed
to belong. The English weavers were especially jealous
of foreigners, and some of their rules had been made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
discourage Flemish and Florentine workmen and traders from
getting a foothold in the market.</p>

<p>Richard had been born in England, and when he was old
enough to earn a living, he intended to repay his mother for
all her hard and lonely work for him. As an apprentice to
the craft he could grow up in it and belong to the Weavers&rsquo;
Guild himself some day, but he thought that if there were any
way to manage it he would rather be a trader. He felt rather
excited now as he hurried to reach the village before the bell
should ring for the opening of the market.</p>

<p>King&rsquo;s Barton was not a very big town, but on market
days it seemed very busy. There was an irregular square in
the middle of the town, with a cross of stone in the center,
and the ringing of this bell gave notice for the opening and
closing of the market. It was not always the same sort of
market. Once a week the farmers brought in their cattle
and sheep. On another day poultry was sold. In the season,
there were corn markets and grass markets, for the crops of
wheat and hay; and in every English town, markets were
held at certain times for whatever was produced in the neighborhood.
Everybody knew when these days came, and merchants
from the larger cities came then to buy or sell&mdash;on
other days they would have found the place half asleep. In
so small a town there was not trade enough to support a shop
for the sale of clothing, jewelry and foreign wares; but a
traveling merchant could do very well on market days.</p>

<p>When Richard came into the square the bell had just
begun to ring, and the booths were already set up and occupied.
His mother had told him to look for Master Elsing,
a man to whom she had sometimes sold her cloth, but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not there. In his stall was a new man. There was some trade
between London and the Hanse, or German cities, and sometimes
they sent men into the country to buy at the fairs and
markets and keep an eye on trade. Master Elsing had been
one of these, and he had always given a fair price. The new
man smiled at the boy with his big roll of cloth, and said,
&ldquo;What have you there, my fine lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard told him. The man looked rather doubtful. &ldquo;Let
me see it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The cloth was a soft, thick rough web with a long furry
nap. If it was made into a cloak the person who wore it
could have the nap sheared off when it was shabby, and wear
it again and shear it again until it was threadbare. A man
who did this work was called a shearman or sherman. The
strange merchant pursed his lips and fingered the cloth. &ldquo;Common
stuff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I doubt me the dyes will not be fast
color, and it will have to be finished at my cost. There is
no profit for me in it, but I should like to help you&mdash;I like
manly boys. What do you want for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard named the price his mother had told him to ask.
There was an empty feeling inside him, for he knew that
unless they sold that cloth they had only threepence to buy
anything whatever to eat, and it would be a long time to next
market day. The merchant laughed. &ldquo;You will never make
a trader if you do not learn the worth of things, my boy,&rdquo;
he said good-naturedly. &ldquo;The cloth is worth more than that.
I will give you sixpence over, just by way of a lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard hesitated. He had never heard of such a thing as
anybody offering more for a thing than was asked, and he
looked incredulously at the handful of silver and copper that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the merchant held out. &ldquo;You had better take it and go
home,&rdquo; the man added. &ldquo;Think how surprised your mother
will be! You can tell her that she has a fine young
son&mdash;Conrad Waibling said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard still hesitated, and Waibling withdrew the money.
&ldquo;You may ask any one in the market,&rdquo; he said impatiently,
&ldquo;and if you get a better price than mine I say no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Richard soberly, &ldquo;I will come back if
I get no other offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took his cloth to the oldest of the merchants and asked
him if he would better Waibling&rsquo;s price, but the man shook
his head. &ldquo;More than it is worth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nobody will
give you that, my boy.&rdquo; And from two others he got the
same reply. He went back to Waibling finally, left the cloth
and took his price.</p>

<p>He had never seen a silver penny before. It had a cross
on one side and the King&rsquo;s head on the other, as the common
pennies did; it was rather tarnished, but he rubbed it on his
jacket to brighten it. He thought he would like to have it
bright and shining when he showed it to his mother. All
the time that he was sitting on a bank by the roadside, a little
way out of the town, eating his bread and cheese, he was
polishing the silver penny. A young man who rode by just
then, with a black-eyed young woman behind him, reined in
his horse and looked down with some amusement. &ldquo;What
art doing, lad?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my silver penny,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I wanted it to be
fine and bonny to show mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; Richard held
up the penny. &ldquo;Who gave you that, my boy?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Waibling the cloth-merchant,&rdquo; said Richard, and
he told the story of the bargain.</p>

<p>The young man looked grave. &ldquo;Barbara,&rdquo; he said to the
girl, &ldquo;art anxious to get home? Because I have business
with this same Waibling, and I want to find him before he
leaves the town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl smiled demurely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like thee, Robert,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Ever since I married thee,&mdash;and long before, it&rsquo;s
been the same. I won&rsquo;t hinder thee. Leave me at Mary
Lavender&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;ll have a look about her garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two rode off at a brisk pace, and Richard saw them
halt at a gate not far away, and while the girl went in the
man mounted his horse again and came back. &ldquo;Jump thee
up behind me, young chap,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll see to this.
The silver penny is not good. He probably got it in some
trade and passed it off on the first person who would take it.
Look at this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edrupt held up a silver penny from his own purse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Richard slowly. &ldquo;I thought all pennies
were alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not&mdash;but until the new law was passed they were
well-nigh anything you please. You see, this penny he gave
you is an old one. Before the new law some time, when the
King needed money very badly,&mdash;in Stephen&rsquo;s time maybe&mdash;they
mixed the silver with lead to make it go further. That&rsquo;s
why it would not shine. And look at this.&rdquo; He took out
another coin. &ldquo;This is true metal, but it has been clipped.
Some thief took a bag full of them probably, clipped each
one as much as he dared, passed off the coins for good money,
and melted down the parings of silver to sell. Next time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
you take a silver penny see that it is pure bright silver and
quite round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time they were in the market-place. Edrupt dismounted,
and gave Richard the bridle to hold; then he went
up to Waibling&rsquo;s stall, but the merchant was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me to mind it for him,&rdquo; said the man in the next
booth. &ldquo;He went out but now and said he would be back
in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the cloth-merchant did not come back. The web of
cloth he had bought from Richard was on the counter, and
that was the only important piece of goods he had bought.
Quite a little crowd gathered about by the time they had
waited awhile. Richard wondered what it all meant. Presently
Edrupt came back, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has left town,&rdquo; he said to Richard. &ldquo;He must have
seen me before I met you. I have had dealings with him
before, and he knew what I would do if I caught him here.
Well, he has left you your cloth and the price of the stuff, less
one bad penny. Will you sell the cloth to me? I am a
wool-merchant, not a cloth-merchant, but I can use a cloak
made of good homespun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard looked up at his new friend with a face so bright
with gratitude and relief that the young merchant laughed
again. &ldquo;What are you going to do with the penny?&rdquo; he asked
the boy, curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to throw it in the river,&rdquo; said Richard in sudden
wrath. &ldquo;Then it would cheat no more poor folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say that if you drop a coin in a stream it is a sign
you will return,&rdquo; said Edrupt, still laughing, &ldquo;and we want
neither Waibling nor his money here again. Suppose we nail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
it up by the market-cross for a warning to others? How
would that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a curious collection of coins
that might be seen, some years later, nailed to a post in the
market of King&rsquo;s Barton. There were also the names of
those who had passed them, and in time, some dishonest goods
also were fastened up there for all to see. When Richard
saw the coin in its new place he gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be going home now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s alone, and
she will be wanting me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ride with me so far as Dame Lavender&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the wool-merchant
good-naturedly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s thy name, by the way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard Garland. Father was a sailor, and his name was
Sebastian,&rdquo; said the boy soberly. &ldquo;Mother won&rsquo;t let me say
he is drowned, but I&rsquo;m afraid he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sebastian Garland,&rdquo; repeated Edrupt thoughtfully. &ldquo;And
so thy mother makes her living weaving wool, does she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; answered Richard. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s frae Dunfermline last,
but she was born in the Highlands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s grandmother was Scotch,&rdquo; said Edrupt absently.
He was trying to remember where he had heard the
name Sebastian Garland. He set Richard down after asking
him where he lived, and took his own way home with
Barbara, his wife of a year. He told Barbara that the town
was well rid of a rascal, but she knew by his silence thereafter
that he was thinking out a plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he spoke out that evening, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be a law
in the land to punish these dusty-footed knaves. They go
from market to market cheating poor folk, and we have no
hold on them because we cannot leave our work. But about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
this lad Richard Garland, Barbara, I&rsquo;ve been a-thinking. What
if we let him and his mother live in the little cottage beyond
the sheepfold? The boy could help in tending the sheep. If
they&rsquo;ve had sheep o&rsquo; their own they&rsquo;ll know how to make
&rsquo;emselves useful, I dare say. And then, when these foreign
fleeces come into the market, the dame could have dyes and
so on, and we should see what kind o&rsquo; cloth they make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first change in the fortunes of Richard Garland
and his mother. A little more than a year later Sebastian
Garland, now captain of Master Gay&rsquo;s ship, the <cite>Rose-in-June</cite>,
of London, came into port and met Robert Edrupt.
On inquiry Edrupt learned that the captain had lost his wife
and son many years before in a town which had been swept
by the plague. When he heard of the Highland-born woman
living in the Longley cottage, he journeyed post-haste to find
her, and discovered that she was indeed his wife, and Richard
his son. By the time that Richard was old enough to become
a trader, a court known as the Court of Pied-poudre or Dusty
Feet had been established by the King at every fair. Its purpose
was to prevent peddlers and wandering merchants from
cheating the folk. The common people got the name &ldquo;Pie-powder
Court,&rdquo; but that made it none the less powerful. King
Henry also appointed itinerant justices&mdash;traveling judges&mdash;to
go about from place to place and judge according to the
King&rsquo;s law, with the aid of the sheriffs of the neighborhood
who knew the customs of the people. The general instructions
of these courts were that when the case was between a rich
man and a poor man, the judges were to favor the poor man
until and unless there was reason to do otherwise. The Norman
barons, coming from a country in which they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
used to be petty kings each in his own estate, did not like
this much, but little the King cared for that. Merchants
like young Richard Garland found it most convenient to
have one law throughout the land for all honest men. Remembering
his own hard boyhood, Richard never failed to
be both just and generous to a boy.</p>

<h2>X<br />
<br />
MARY LAVENDER&rsquo;S GARDEN<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW MARY LAVENDER CAME TO BE OF SERVICE TO AN EXILED
QUEEN</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mary Lavender</span> lived in a garden. That seems
really the best way to say it. The house of Dame
Annis Lavender was hardly more than four walls and
a roof, a green door and two small hooded windows.
Instead of the house having a garden the garden seemed
rather to hold the cottage in a blossomy lap.</p>

<p>A long time ago there had been a castle on the low hill
above the cottage. It was a Saxon castle, roughly built of
great half-hewn stones, its double walls partly of tramped
earth. Nearly a century had passed since a Norman baron
had received the &ldquo;hundred&rdquo; in which the castle stood, as a
reward for having helped Duke William become William the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Conqueror. His domain was large enough for a hundred
families to live on, getting their living from the land. The
original Saxon owner had fled to join Hereward at Ely, and
he never came back.</p>

<p>This rude Saxon castle was not what the Norman needed,
at all. He must have, if he meant to be safe in this hostile
land, a fortress much harder to take. He chose a taller hill
just beyond the village, made it higher with most of the
stone from the old castle, and built there a great square frowning
keep and some smaller towers, with a double wall of
stone, topped by battlements, round the brow of the hill, and
a ditch around all. No stream being convenient to fill the
moat he left it dry. Here, where the Saxon castle had been,
was nothing but a dimpled green mound, starred over in
spring with pink and white baby daisies, and besprinkled with
dwarf buttercups and the little flower that English children
call Blue Eyes. Mary liked to take her distaff there and spin.
The old castle had been built to guard a ford. The Normans
had made a stone bridge at a narrower and deeper point in
the river, and Dame Annis and Mary washed linen in the
pool above the ford.</p>

<p>The countryside had settled down to the rule of the Normans
with hardly more trouble than the dismantled mound.
Travelers often came over the new bridge and stayed at
the inn on their way to or from London, and there were more
than twice as many houses as there had been when Mary&rsquo;s
mother was a girl. Older people complained that the country
could never endure so much progress. This was a rather
remote region, given over mainly to sheep-grazing. On the
great extent of &ldquo;common&rdquo; still unfenced, the sheep wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as they liked, and they often came nibbling about Mary&rsquo;s
feet as she sat on the mound.</p>

<p>There had been a garden about the ancient castle&mdash;several,
in fact: the herb-garden, the vegetable garden, and a sort of
out-door nursery for fruits and berries. The last had been
against a southward-facing wall and was nearly destroyed;
but herbs are tenacious things, and the old roots had spread
into the vegetable patch, and flowers had seeded themselves,
until Dame Annis moved into the little cottage and began to
make her living.</p>

<p>Most of the old-fashioned cottage-garden flowers could be
found there. Thrift raised its rose-red spikes in crevices of a
ruined wall. Bluebells, the wild hyacinths, made heavenly
patches of color among the copses. Great beds of mustard
and lavender, in early summer, were like a purple-and-gold
mantle flung down upon a field. Presently violets bloomed
in orderly rows in Dame Annis&rsquo;s new herb-garden, and roses
were pruned and trimmed and trained over old walls and
trees.</p>

<p>It may seem odd that violets and roses should be among
herbs. The truth is that very few flowers were cultivated
in the early Middle Ages simply for ornament. Violets were
used to make perfume. Roses were made into rose-water
and also into rose conserve, a kind of sweetmeat of rose-petals,
sugar and spice packed in little jars. Marigolds were brought
from the East by returning Crusaders for use in broth. Pennyroyal,
feverfew, camomile, parsley, larkspur, and other flowers
used to be grown for making medicine. One of the few herbs
which grow in modern gardens, which the Conqueror found
in England when he came, is tansy. The name comes from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Greek word meaning immortality. Tansy was used to preserve
meat, and to flavor various dishes. There were also
sage, marjoram, thyme, and many other herbs of which Dame
Annis did not know the names. One of the most precious finds
that she made in her digging and transplanting was a root
of woad. This plant was used for blue dye, and was so much
in demand that England did not produce enough and had to
import it. It was too valuable for her to use it herself; she
cherished it and fed the soil, planting every seed, promising
Mary that some day she should have a gown dyed watchet
blue, of linen from their own flax. Mary was thinking about
that gown as she sat spinning and listening to the hum of the
bees. She knew exactly how it would be made from beginning
to end.</p>

<p>The flax would be soaked in the brook until the strong
stem-fibers were all that were left; it would be hackled and
washed and spun and finally woven by their neighbor, Dame
Garland, for Mary&rsquo;s mother had no loom. This neighbor
was as poor as themselves, but they would pay her in herbs
and dyestuffs. The leaves&mdash;not the flowers, which were
yellow&mdash;from the woad, would be crushed into a paste and
allowed to ferment, and finally made into little balls that
would keep until needed.</p>

<p>Neither perfume nor dye could be bought in shops thereabouts,
and there were no factories anywhere for making
either. Dame Lavender had been, before she was married,
maid to a great lady who had taught her women how to make
such things out of the plants in the castle garden. Now,
when her husband failed to come back from the wars in France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
she turned to the perfumer&rsquo;s trade as the one which she knew
best.</p>

<p>There are a great many ways of making perfume at home.
If she had had a still, Dame Lavender could have made almost
any sort of ordinary perfume, flavor or medicine. In this
process, a mixture of blossoms, spices and drugs, or the blossoms
alone, or the leaves, is cooked in a glass bottle called a
retort, with a long glass tube fitted to it so that the steam
must pass through the tube and cool in little drops. These
drops run out into a glass flask and are the perfume. Another
way was to gather flowers when perfectly fresh and put them
into a kettle of alcohol, which would take up the scent and
keep it after the flowers are taken out. Strong-scented flowers
or leaves were put with salve in a jar and covered, to
perfume the salve. Dried plants of pleasant fragrance, mixed
with salve, could be left until the scent had been taken up,
then the whole could be melted and strained to remove the
herbs. Each herb and flower had to be gathered at the proper
time, and dried in the little attic. With this business, and
the honey which the bees made, and the spinning done by
both mother and daughter, they managed to make a living.</p>

<p>One day when they were at their busiest an old man came
to the door and asked for a night&rsquo;s lodging. He had a gentle
way of speaking, although his cloak was threadbare, and he
seemed much interested in their work. He knew some of
the plants which they had never been able to name, and told
what they were good for. He seemed so old, poor and feeble,
that although she really needed all the money she could earn,
Dame Lavender refused the coin he offered her. She felt
that if he fell ill somewhere, he might need it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The Norman castle on the hill had not been really lived
in for some ten years. There was a company of soldiers in it,
with two or three knights who came and went, but that was
all. It had been built as a fortress, and was one; and the
situation was such that it could not easily be made into anything
else. The baron who owned it was in attendance upon
the King.</p>

<p>Then, one day, a rumor went floating about the village, like
the scent of growing hedges in spring. It was said that the
castle was to be set in order for some great lady; and that she
would bring with her two or three maids perhaps, but most
of the work was to be done by the people of the village.
This was rather mystifying. Mary wondered why a great
lady should not rather choose to stay at the nunnery, where
the Lady Abbess had all things seemly and well-planned. It
was an old Saxon religious house and not at all rich; but Mary
always liked to have an errand up Minchen Lane. The lane
had got its name from the nuns, who were called &ldquo;minchens&rdquo;
a long while ago. Sometimes they sent to get some roots or
plants from the garden of Dame Lavender. She had some
kinds that they had not.</p>

<p>It was nearly certain, at any rate, that the housekeeper
at the castle would want lavender and violets, and Dame
Annis told Mary to get the besom and sweep out the still-room.
This was a shed with a stone floor, the only room they
had which was not used for living or sleeping. The room
they had given their strange guest, Tomaso of Padua as he
called himself, was the one where Mary and her mother usually
slept, and they had made up a pallet in the attic.</p>

<p>Mary worked briskly with her besom. It was just such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a broom as English people still use to sweep garden walks, a
bundle of twigs tied on a stick handle with a pliant osier.
While she was at work she heard the gate shut, and saw old
Tomaso coming in.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that she was exactly glad to see him.
She felt that they might have all that they could do without
a lodger just then. She spoke to him courteously, however,
and he smiled as if he read her thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not come to ask for your hospitality this time,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but to bring your good mother something in return
for her kindness.&rdquo; Beckoning to a boy who stood outside, he
opened the gate, and the boy led in a little donkey laden
with the basket-work saddle-bags called paniers. From these
Tomaso took all the parts of a still, some fine earthen and
glass jars, flasks and bowls, and bundles of spice which were
like a whole garden packed into a basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be of assistance to your mother in
her work. I see her coming now, and I will talk with her
awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary felt as if the earth had turned inside out when she
heard the outcome of that conversation. The lady who was
coming to the castle was Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen of England,
and her coming was a considerable responsibility to
every one concerned. She had been found just ready to join
her sons, Richard and Geoffrey, in Aquitaine, where they were
fighting against their father, and she was to be shut up in
this remote fortress, in charge of one of the King&rsquo;s most
trusted knights, until he had disposed of the rebellion and
had time to consider the case. She would not, she declared,
spend her days in a nunnery, and the nuns of Minchen Lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
were anything but anxious to have her. There was a room
in the Norman castle which could be fitted up as a still-room,
and it was desirable to have whatever was needed made within
the walls if possible. Would Mary undertake to go there
and make herself useful, either in ways that might aid the
cook, or in any other duties that she saw? The cook was an
Italian. The maids of honor were daughters of Norman-French
families. Barbara Edrupt, the wife of the wool-merchant
who owned Longley Farm, was also, it appeared, going
to lend a hand with the spinning and train one or two country
girls for the rough work. It was no small task to maintain
a royal lady in fitting state, even though she was a prisoner.
It was more difficult here because there was little or nothing
to do it with, and peddlers, merchants and other purveyors
from distant London or Paris might be a source of danger.</p>

<p>Dame Annis Lavender was rather doubtful, but she had
confidence in Mary, and it was settled that Mary should go.
She was to have the gown of blue sooner than she thought.
The flax was already spun, Dame Garland did the weaving,
and she and Mary&rsquo;s mother dipped and dipped again until
the web was a deep exquisite blue like a summer sky. Barbara
made Mary a gift of a fair white linen cap and kerchief.
The two girls, Barbara with her black eyes and hair, Mary
with her gold-brown braids and calm blue eyes and wild-rose
coloring, made a pretty picture together.</p>

<p>So at least thought the troubadour who came riding by
and saw them. He was in attendance upon the castellan,
Thibaut of Toulouse, and a little group of maids and pages
coming to make ready for the Queen, who was expected to
arrive the next day. Thibaut&rsquo;s wife had been a Provençal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
lady, and his daughter Philippa, by whose side the troubadour
was riding, was a trifle homesick for her childhood
speech. She was very glad of Ranulph&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>As they came past the garden she bent sidewise in her
saddle and looked eagerly toward the gate. &ldquo;Do you
see&mdash;there?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That is a Provence rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will bring you some,&rdquo; the troubadour answered, and a
moment later he was striding toward the two girls among
the flowers. They had never seen any one like him,&mdash;so gay,
so courteous and so straightforward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come to beg a rose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are not these the red
roses of Provence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; answered Barbara. &ldquo;I brought the bush from
my own home, and gave Mary a cutting. There never was
such a rose for bloom and sweetness, we think. My husband
he says so too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara blushed and smiled a little when she spoke of Robert,
and she and Mary quickly filled a basket with the roses.
The next morning Ranulph came again with the Provençal
maid of honor to get more flowers, and &ldquo;strowing herbs,&rdquo;&mdash;sweet-scented
plants that gave out their fragrance when trodden
upon. The rushes used for floor-covering were often
mixed with these on festival days, and when new rushes were
to be put down the whole might be swept into the fire and
burned. The maids of honor made garlands for the wall, and
thus the first breath of air the Queen drew in her grim, small
stone rooms high in the castle keep, was laden with the scent
of the blossoms of the South.</p>

<p>It was a cheerless abode, Mary and Barbara thought. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were no hangings, no costly dishes nor candlesticks, no weapons
or anything that could be made into a weapon, nor any
jewels or rich clothing.</p>

<p>Mary wondered a little that certain richly embroidered tapestries
which belonged to the nuns had not been borrowed,
for she knew that the Lady Abbess had lent them now and
then. Philippa could have told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the Queen haughtily when she had seen
her apartments, &ldquo;that they have given me no gold-woven
arras for my prison. I think I would burn it for the gold&mdash;if
any of these jailers of mine could be bought perchance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captivity of the royal prisoner was not, however, very
severe. She sometimes rode out under guard, she was allowed
to walk upon the terrace and in the walled garden, and she
talked sometimes with the troubadour and with old Tomaso.
In one of the older towers of the castle the physician had his
rooms, and here he read in ancient books, or brewed odd mixtures
in his retorts and crucibles. He taught Mary more
about the management of a still, the use of herbs and the
making of essences than she had ever dreamed there was
to learn. Physicians in those days might be quacks or
alchemists. Here and there one was what we call an experimental
chemist. Nearly a hundred years later some of Tomaso&rsquo;s
papers proved most valuable to the University of
Padua.</p>

SAINT CRISPIN&rsquo;S DAY<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW CRISPIN, THE SHOEMAKER&rsquo;S SON, MADE A SHOE FOR A
LITTLE DAMSEL, AND NEW STREETS IN LONDON</span></h2>

</div></div></div>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">London</span> was a busy town when the long Venetian
galleys and the tall ships of Spain anchored in the
Pool of the Thames. Leather and silk and linen and
velvet and broadcloth came to the London wharves, and
London people were busy buying, selling, making and decorating
every sort of apparel, from the girdle to hold a sword to
the silken hood and veil of a lady. And nobody was busier
than the men who worked in leather.</p>

<p>Nowadays we go into a shop and try on shoes made perhaps
a thousand miles away, until we find a pair that will fit. But
when Crispin Eyre&rsquo;s father sold a pair of shoes he had seen
those shoes made in his own shop, under his own eye, and
chosen the leather. It might be calfskin from the yard of a
tanner, who bought his hides from the man who had raised
the calf on his farm, or it might be fine soft goatskin out of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
bale from the galleons of Spain. In either case he had to know
all about leather, or he would not succeed in the shoe business.
The man who aspired to be a master shoemaker had to know
how to make the whole shoe. More different kinds of shoes
were made in Thomas Eyre&rsquo;s shop than most shops sell to-day,
and as he had begun to use the hammer and the awl when
he was not yet ten years old, he knew how every kind should
be made.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before a modern family would be
awake, hammers were going in the shoe-shops&mdash;tap-tap&mdash;tick-a-tack&mdash;tack!
Sometimes by the light of a betty lamp in the
early winter evenings the journeymen would be still at work,
drawing the waxed thread carefully and quickly through the
leather. Hand-sewn and made of well-tanned hide, such a
shoe could be mended again and again before it was outworn.
Riding-boots, leather shoes, slippers, sandals, clogs, pattens,
shoes of cloth, silk, morocco, cloth-of-gold, velvet, with soles
made of wood, leather, cork and sometimes even iron, went to
and fro in the shadow of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and sooner
or later every kind crossed the threshold of Thomas Eyre&rsquo;s
shop. The well-to-do came to order shoes for themselves, and
the wooden-shod and barefoot came to get the shoes others
would wear.</p>

<p>Each trade kept to its own street, even in those early days.
When the Guilds had multiplied so that each part of each
trade had its own workers, who were not supposed to do anything
outside their trade, the man who made a shoe never
mended one, and the cobbler never made anything. Each
trade had its Guild Hall, where the members met for business
councils or holidays, and some of them had their favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
churches. It was like a very exclusive club. Men and women
belonged to these societies, they made rules about the length
of time a man must work before he could be a master workman,
and they took care of their own poor folk out of a common
fund. Each Guild had its patron saint, connected in some
way with the craft it represented. The especial saint of the
shoemakers was St. Crispin, and his day was the twenty-fifth
of October.</p>

<p>The leather workers were among the most important artisans
of London, and in course of time each branch of the trade
had its own Guild Hall. The cordwainers or leather workers
took their name from Cordova in Spain, famous for its beautiful
dyed, stamped, gilded and decorated leather. The saddlers
had their hall, and the lorimers or harness-makers theirs,
and the skinners and leather sellers and tanners had theirs.
London was rather behind some of the cities on the Continent,
however, both in the number and the power of her guilds.
King Henry&nbsp;II. was not over-inclined to favor guilds, especially
in London, for London was too independent, as it was,
to please him. He had observed that when cities grew so
strong that they governed themselves they were quite likely to
make trouble for Kings, and not unnaturally, he felt that he
had trouble enough on his hands as things were without inviting
more. If he had allowed it London would have had a
&ldquo;Commune,&rdquo; as the organization of a self-governing city was
called, long ago.</p>

<p>Crispin heard this discussed more or less, for all sorts of
chattering and story-telling went on in the shop, and he heard
also many stories which tended to make him think. The popular
tales and songs of the Middle Ages were not by any means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
always respectful to Kings. The people understood very
well that there were good monarchs and bad ones, and they
were not blind to the reasons for the difference.</p>

<p>The story that Crispin liked best was the one about his own
name, and on this October day, seated on his low bench beside
Simon, the oldest of his shoemakers, he asked for it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, I&rsquo;ll warrant,&rdquo; grunted Simon, &ldquo;an Eyre would be
a born shoemaker, and name him Crispin&mdash;&mdash; Eh, lad, what
be you after with that leather?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crispin&rsquo;s fingers were strong, if small, and he was busy
with hammer and awl and waxed thread, making a little shoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a shoe, Simon&mdash;go on with the story,&rdquo; said the boy,
with a little, shut-mouthed grin. Simon fitted the sole to the
boot he was making and picked up his hammer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a long time ago&mdash;(tap-tap) when the emperor of
Rome was a-hunting down the blessed martyrs, that there were
two brothers, Crispin and Crispian their names were, who
lived in Rome and did nothing but kindness to every one. But
there be rascals&mdash;(trip-trip-trap!)&mdash;who do not understand
kindness, and ever repay it with evil. One of such a sort
lived in the same street as the two brothers, and secretly ran
to tell the Emperor that they were plotting against his life.
Then privately the wife of this evil-doer came and warned
them, for that they had given her shoes to her feet. So they
fled out of the city by night and came to France and dwelt
in Soissons, where the cathedral now is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This England was a heathen country then, they say, and
France not much better. Before long the king of that kingdom
heard of the strangers and sent for them to know what
their business was. When they said that their business was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to teach the people the story of our Lord, he asked who this
lord might be, and whether he was mightier than the king, or
not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then when the heathen king heard that the Lord of Crispin
and Crispian was more powerful than either King or
emperor he had a mind to kill them, but he was afraid. He
asked if they had ever seen a palace finer than his own, that
was made of wood and hung with painted leather, and they
said that there were finer ones in Rome. Then said the king,
&lsquo;Give me a sign of the greatness of your Lord.&rsquo; And they
asked him what it should be. And the king said, &lsquo;Cover the
streets of my city with leather and you shall go forth unharmed.&rsquo;
Only the rich had any leather in those parts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night Crispin and Crispian took the leather hide
of their girdles and made a pair of shoes for the king. And
when they came before him in the morning, they put the
shoes upon his feet, the first shoes he had ever seen, and told
him to walk abroad and he would find all the streets covered
with leather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The apprentices had been listening, and a laugh went round
the shop, as it always did at that part of the tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus it came to pass,&rdquo; concluded Simon, &ldquo;that the two
brothers lived at court and taught the king&rsquo;s leather workers
how to make shoes, and that is why Saint Crispin is the friend
of shoemakers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the name of him who told you the tale, Simon?&rdquo;
Crispin asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is dead these many years, but his name was Benet,
and he came from Soissons, and had been to Rome and seen
the street where the brothers lived. He had a nail out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
one of the shoes they made for the king. People came to our
house while he was with us, only to see that nail and hear
the story. I heard it so many times that I learned it by heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Simon drove in the last nail with a vicious stroke that
sent it well into the leather. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
blessed Saint Crispin made none o&rsquo; them shoes we make here,
with pointed toes and rose windows on the leather, fitten for
a lady.&rdquo; <a href="#ill01">He held up the shoe with great disfavor.</a> It was
for a courtier, and the toe was two feet long and turned up,
with a chain to fasten it to the knee. The front of the shoe
was cut into open work in a wheel shape to show the gay
silken hose underneath, and the shoe itself was of soft fine
leather. With a parting sniff, Simon tossed it to a slim, grinning
youth who would finish it by putting on gilding.</p>

<p>The shoe that Crispin was making was of a different sort.
It was a little round-toed sturdy thing, about the right size
for a child of ten. The mate to it was on the bench at his side,
and he put them together and looked at them rather ruefully.
The shoe he had made was plain, and the other was trimmed
daintily with red morocco and cut in a quaint round pattern
on the toe&mdash;the decoration that was known as &ldquo;a Paul&rsquo;s window,&rdquo;
because the geometric cut-work with the colored lining
looked like stained glass. Crispin frowned and shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s ailin&rsquo; ye, lad?&rdquo; Old Simon peered at the shoes
in the boy&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Bless ye, those ben&rsquo;t mates!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, but I haven&rsquo;t any colored leather for this
one even if I knew how to finish it,&rdquo; Crispin said with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m!&rdquo; Simon looked more closely at the little gay
shoe. &ldquo;That never came from these parts. That&rsquo;s Turkey
leather.&rdquo; He gave Crispin a sharp glance. The great bell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Bow was ringing and the apprentices were quitting work.
&ldquo;Where did this shoe come from, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crispin hesitated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell, now, Simon. I found a
little maid crying in Candlewick street&mdash;standing on one foot
like a duck because she had lost her other shoe. She was so
light I could lift her up, and I set her on a wall while I looked
for the shoe, but it wasn&rsquo;t any good, for a horse had stepped
on it. She cried so about the shoe that I&mdash;I said I would make
her another. And then her father came back for her and took
her away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who might she be?&rdquo; inquired Simon dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t tell father. She said she would
send for the shoes though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simon had been rummaging in a leather bag behind his
bench. &ldquo;If she don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s plenty of other little wenches
that wear shoes. If the leather should be blue in place o&rsquo; red,
would that matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so; one shoe is no good alone.&rdquo; Crispin
began to be hopeful.</p>

<p>Old Simon pulled out some pieces of soft fine leather the
color of a harebell and began to cut them quickly and deftly
into fine scalloped borders. &ldquo;This ben&rsquo;t Turkey leather,
but it is a piece from Spain, and they learnt the trade of the
paynim, so I reckon &rsquo;twill do. Stitch this on the other shoe
in place o&rsquo; the red, and I&rsquo;ll cut the pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody would have believed that Simon&rsquo;s old, crooked
fingers could handle a knife so cleverly. In no time the pattern
on the old shoe had been copied exactly on the new one.
When Crispin had stitched the blue cut-work border on both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and Simon had rubbed the new leather on some old scraps and
cleaned the old a bit, the two little shoes looked like twins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a boy here named Crispin Eyre?&rdquo; inquired a man&rsquo;s
voice from the doorway. Almost at the same time came the
sweet lilting speech of a little girl, &ldquo;Oh, father, that is the boy
who was so kind to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crispin and old Simon stood up and bowed, for the man
who spoke was a dignified person in the furred cloak and cap
of a well-to-do merchant. The little girl held fast to her
father&rsquo;s hand and gazed into the shop with bright interest.
&ldquo;Look at the shoes, father, aren&rsquo;t they pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant balanced the little shoes in his broad hand.
&ldquo;Which did you lose, Genevieve, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, father,&rdquo; the child said, pursing her
soft lips. &ldquo;Cannot you tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said the merchant thoughtfully, &ldquo;if a London
shoemaker&rsquo;s boy does work like this I doubt Edrupt may
be right when he says our ten fingers are as good as any. This
shoe is one of a pair from Cordova. Who&rsquo;s your father, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father is Thomas Eyre, so please you, master,&rdquo; said
the boy proudly, &ldquo;and I am Crispin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good craft and a good name and a good workman,&rdquo; said
the merchant, and dropped a coin into the litter of leather
scraps. It was the full price of a new pair of shoes.</p>

<p>Crispin certainly could not have dreamed that his kindness
to little Genevieve Gay would be the occasion of new streets
in London, but it happened so. Master Gay, the merchant,
came later to talk with Thomas Eyre about the shoe trade.
Then, instead of sending a cargo of Irish hides abroad he gave
Eyre the choice of them. Other shoemakers took the rest, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
shoe trade of London grew, and so did the tanneries. The
tanners presently needed more room by running water, and
sought new quarters outside London Wall. The business of
London kept on growing until the Leatherworkers&rsquo; Guild had
presently to send abroad for their own raw material. England
became more and more a manufacturing country and less a
farming country. In one or another trade almost every farming
product was of use. Hides were made into leather, beef
went to the cook-shops; horn was made into drinking-cups and
lantern-lights, bones were ground or burnt for various purposes,
tallow made candles. What the farmer had been used
to do for himself on his farm, the Guilds began to do in companies,
and their farm was England.</p>

<h2>XII<br />
<br />
THE LOZENGES OF GIOVANNI<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW A MILANESE BAKER-BOY AND A PADUAN PHYSICIAN
KEPT POISON OUT OF THE KING&rsquo;S DISH</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Ranulph</span> the troubadour was riding along a lonely
moorland trail, singing softly to himself. In so poor a
neighborhood there was little fear of robbers, and the
Barbary horse which he had under him could outrun
most other horses. The light-stepping hoofs made little noise
upon the springy turf, and as the song ended he heard some
one sobbing behind a group of stunted bushes. He halted
and listened. The sound ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho there, little one&mdash;what is the trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke in Saxon, the language of the country folk, but
at the first words a figure sprang up and dodged from shrub to
rock like a scared leveret. He called again quickly in French:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hola! little friend, wait a moment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer. Somehow he did not like to leave
the mystery unsolved. There must be a child in trouble,
but what child could there be in this wild place, and neither
Norman nor Saxon? It was not far enough to the West to
be Welsh borderland, and it was too far south to be near either
Scotland or the Danelaw. He spoke in Provençal, and the
fugitive halted at the sound of the soft southern o&rsquo;s and a&rsquo;s;
then he spoke again in the Lombard dialect of Milan. A boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
ventured out of the thicket and stood staring at him. Ranulph
flung himself off his horse and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, little comrade, and tell me who you are, and
why you are all alone here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s dark eyes grew wider in his elvish face and his
hands opened and shut nervously as he answered in Italian:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no one, and I have no home. Take me not to prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no thought of a prison, my lad, but I cannot
wait here. Come, ride with me, and I will take you to a kind
woman who will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy hesitated, but at last loneliness conquered timidity
and distrust, and he came. The troubadour swung him up to
the front of the saddle and they rode on through the gathering
dusk. Forgetting his terror as he heard the familiar sound of
his native tongue, the boy told his story readily enough. His
name was Giovanni Bergamotto, but he had been born in
Milan, in the year that Barbarossa crossed the Alps. The first
thing that he could really remember was his mother crying
over her father and two brothers, who had been killed in the
siege. He remembered many days when there was nothing to
eat in the house. When Milan was taken he was old enough
to walk at his mother&rsquo;s side as the people were driven out and
the city destroyed so that no one should ever live there again.
His father had been killed when the Emperor hung a siege-tower
all over with hostages and captives to be shot at by their
own people within the walls. He remembered his grandfather
lifting him up to see when the Carocchio was brought out,
and the great crucifix above the globe was lowered to do
homage to the Emperor. He remembered seeing the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
banner unfurled from the top of the Cathedral. These things,
his grandfather told him, no Milanese should ever forget.</p>

<p>He and his mother had wandered about from one city to
another until his mother died, two or three years later. He
had worked for a pastry cook who beat him and starved him.
At last he had run away and stolen his passage on a ship
bound for England. They had beaten him when they found
him, but kept him to help the cook. When he landed at a
southern port on the English coast, he had found himself in
a land of cold mist, where no sun shone, no fruit grew, and
no one knew his language. He had turned at first naturally
to the towns, for he was a city boy and craved the companionship
of the crowd. But when he said that he was a Lombard
they seemed to be angry. Perhaps there was some dreadful
mistake, and he was in a land where the Ghibellines, the
friends of the Emperor, were the rulers.</p>

<p>When at last he faltered out this question his new friend
gave a compassionate little laugh and patted his shoulder reassuringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, little one, there is no fear of that. This is England,
and the English King rules all the people. We have neither
Guelf nor Ghibelline. A red rose here&mdash;is just a rose,&rdquo; he
added as he saw Giovanni&rsquo;s questioning look at the crimson
rose in his cap. Red roses were the flower of the Guelf party
in North-Italian cities, as the white rose was the badge of the
Ghibellines who favored the Imperial party; and the cities
were divided between the two and fiercely partisan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lombards in London,&rdquo; Ranulph went on, &ldquo;are often
money-lenders, and this the people hate. That is why thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
black hair and eyes and thy Lombard tongue made them suspect
thee, little comrade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Giovanni gave a long sigh of relief and fell silent, and
when he was lifted off the horse at the door of Dame Lavender
he had to be shaken awake to eat his supper. Then he
was put to bed in a corner of the attic under the thatched
roof, and the fragrance of well-known herbs and flowers came
stealing into his dreams on the silent wind of the night.</p>

<p>Language is not needed when a boy finds himself in the
home of a born mother. All the same, Giovanni felt still more
as if he must have waked up in heaven when he found sitting
by the hearth a kind, grave old man who was himself an
Italian, and to whom the tragedy of the downfall of Milan
was known. Tomaso the physician told Dame Lavender all
about it while Giovanni was helping Mary sort herbs in the
still-room. Mary had learned a little of the physician&rsquo;s language
and knew what he liked, and partly by signs, partly
in hobbling Italian, they arrived at a plan for making a
vegetable soup and cooking a chicken for dinner in a way that
Giovanni knew. As the fragrance of the simmering broth
came in at the door Tomaso sniffed it, smiled and went to see
what the little waif was about. Standing in the doorway he
watched Giovanni slicing garlic and nodded to himself. Men
had died of a swift dagger-thrust in a bye-street of Lombardy
because they cut an onion or ate an orange in the enemy&rsquo;s
fashion. By such small signs were Guelf and Ghibelline
known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said the old physician, when dinner was over and
Giovanni, pleased beyond measure at the compliments paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
his cooking, was awaiting further orders, &ldquo;do you know that
Milan is going to be rebuilt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Milanese boy&rsquo;s pinched white face lighted with incredulous
rapture. &ldquo;Rebuilt?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; said Tomaso. &ldquo;The people of four Lombard
cities met in secret and made that vow not three years after
the Emperor gained his victory. They have built a city at the
joining of two rivers, and called it Alexandria after the Pope
whom he drove out of Rome. He still has his own governors
in the cities that he conquered, but the League is gaining every
month. Milan will be once more the Queen of the Midland&mdash;perhaps
before very long. But it is a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may kill me,&rdquo; Giovanni stammered, &ldquo;but I will not
tell. I will never tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tomaso smiled. &ldquo;I knew that, my son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
is why I spoke of this to you. You may talk freely to me or
to Ranulph the troubadour, but to no one else unless we give
you leave. You must be patient, wise and industrious, and
fit yourself to be a true citizen of the Commune. For the
present, you must be a good subject of the English King, and
learn the language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Giovanni hid the precious secret in his heart during the
months that followed, and learned both English and French
with a rapidity that astonished Dame Lavender. He had a
wisdom in herbs and flowers, too, that was almost uncanny.
In the kitchen-gardens of the great houses where he had
been a scullion, there were many plants used for perfumes,
flavorings or coloring fluids, which were quite unknown to
the English cook. He was useful to Dame Lavender both
in the garden and the still-room. He knew how to make various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
delicious cakes as well, and how to combine spices and
honey and syrups most cunningly, for he had seen pastry-cooks
and confectioners preparing state banquets, and he never
forgot anything he had seen.</p>

<p>The castle which crowned the hill in the midst of the small
town where Dame Lavender lived had lately been set in order
for the use of a very great lady&mdash;a lady not young, but accustomed
to luxury and good living&mdash;and all the resources
of Dame Lavender&rsquo;s garden had been taxed to provide perfumes,
ointments and fresh rose-leaves, for the linen-presses
and to be strewn about the floors. Mary and her mother had
all that they could do in serving Queen Eleanor.</p>

<p>The Queen was not always easy to please. In her youth
she had traveled with Crusaders and known the strange cities
of the East; she had escaped once from a castle by night, in
a boat, to free herself from a too-persistent suitor. She was
not one of the meek ladies who spent their days in needlework,
and as for spinning and weaving, she had asked scornfully
if they would have her weave herself a hair shirt like
a hermit. Mary Lavender was not, of course, a maid of
honor, but she found that the Queen seemed rather to like
having her about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had your secret, Marie of the Flowers,&rdquo; said
graceful Philippa, one weary day. &ldquo;Tell me what you do,
that our Lady the Queen likes so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary smiled in her frank, fearless way. &ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; she
answered, &ldquo;that it is the fragrance of the flowers. She desires
now to embroider red roses for a cushion, and I have to
ask Master Tomaso how to dye the thread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The embroidering of red roses became popular at once, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
soon there was a new trouble. The Queen began to find fault
with her food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This cook flavors all his dishes alike,&rdquo; she said pettishly.
&ldquo;He thinks that colored toys of pastry and isinglass feed a
man&rsquo;s stomach. When the King comes here&mdash;although he
never knows what is set before him, that is true,&mdash;I would
like well to have a fit meal for his gentlemen. Tell this Beppo
that if he cannot cook plain toothsome dishes I will send for a
farmer&rsquo;s wench from Longley Farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first that had been heard of the King&rsquo;s intended
visit, and great was the excitement in the kitchen. Ranulph
dismounted at the door of Dame Lavender&rsquo;s cottage and asked
for Giovanni. Beppo the cook had been calling for more help,
and the local labor market furnished nothing that suited
him. Would Giovanni come? He would do anything for
Ranulph and for Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is settled, then,&rdquo; laughed Ranulph. &ldquo;I shall not
have to scour the country for a scullion with hands about
him instead of hoofs or horns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his fourteen years of poverty the little Italian had
learned to hold his tongue and keep his eyes open. Beppo
was glad enough to have a helper who did not have to be
told anything twice, and in the hurry-scurry of the preparations
Giovanni made himself useful beyond belief. The cakes,
however, did not suit the Queen. Mary came looking for
Giovanni in the kitchen-garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanni,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you make some of your lozenges
for the banquet? Beppo says you may. I think that perhaps
his cakes are not simple enough, and I know that the King
likes plain fare.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Giovanni turned rather white. &ldquo;Very well, Mistress Mary,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>

<p>Giovanni&rsquo;s lozenges were not candies, although they were
diamond-shaped like the lozenges that are named after them.
They were cakes made after the recipe still used in some
Italian bakeries. He pounded six ounces of almonds; then he
weighed eight eggs and put enough pounded sugar in the
opposite scale to balance them; then he took out the eggs
and weighed an equal amount of flour, and of butter. He
melted the butter in a little silver saucepan. The eggs were
not beaten, because egg-beaters had not been invented; they
were strained through a sieve from a height into a bowl, and
thus mixed with air. Two of the eggs were added to the
pounded almonds, and then the whole was mixed with a
wooden spoon in a wooden bowl. The paste was spread on
a thin copper plate and baked in an oven built into the stone
wall and heated by a fireplace underneath. While still warm
the cake was cut into diamond-shaped pieces, called lozenges
after the carved stone memorial tablets in cathedrals. The
Queen approved them, and said that she would have those
cakes and none other for the banquet, but with a little more
spice. Beppo, who had paid the sweetmeats a grudging compliment,
produced some ground spice from his private stores
and told Giovanni to use that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanni,&rdquo; said Mary laughing as she passed through the
kitchen on the morning of the great day, &ldquo;do you always scour
your dishes as carefully as this?&rdquo; The boy looked up from
the copper plate which he was polishing. Mary thought he
looked rather somber for a cook who had just been promoted
to the office of baker to the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Things cannot be too clean,&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;Mistress
Mary, will you ask Master Tomaso for some of the spice that
he gave to your mother, for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary&rsquo;s blue eyes opened. Surely a court cook like Beppo
ought to have all the spice needed for a simple cake like this.
However, she brought Giovanni a packet of the fragrant stuff
an hour later, and found Beppo fuming because the work
was delayed. The basket of selected eggs had been broken,
the melted butter had been spilled, and the cakes were not yet
ready for the oven. Giovanni silently and deftly finished
beating his pastry, added the spice, rolled out the dough,
began the baking. When the cakes came out of the oven,
done to a turn, and with a most alluring smell, he stood over
them as they cooled and packed them carefully with his own
hands into a basket. Mary Lavender came through the kitchen
just as the last layer was put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are beautiful cakes, Vanni,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;I
am sure they are fit for the King. Did you use the spice I gave
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Giovanni&rsquo;s heart gave a thump. He had not reckoned on
the fact that simple Mary had grown up where there was no
need of hiding a plain truth, and now Beppo would know.
The cook turned on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? What?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You did not use my spices?
You take them and do not use them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary began to feel frightened. The cook&rsquo;s black eyes were
flashing and his mustache bristling with excitement, until he
looked like the cross cat on the border of the Queen&rsquo;s book
of fables. But Giovanni was standing his ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used good spice,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;Try and see.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>He held out one of the cakes to Beppo, who dashed it furiously
to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are my spices?&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;You meant to steal
them?&rdquo; He dashed at the lad and seized him as if to search
for the spices. Giovanni shook in his grasp like a rat in the
jaws of a terrier, but he did not cringe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent that packet of spice to Master Tomaso an hour
ago,&rdquo; he gasped defiantly, &ldquo;asking him if it was wholesome to
use in the kitchen&mdash;and here he is now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At sight of the old physician standing calm as a judge in
the doorway, Beppo bolted through the other door, seized a
horse that stood in the courtyard and was gone before the
astonished servants got their breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; inquired Tomaso. &ldquo;I came to warn
that man that the packet of spice which you sent is poison.
Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cook bought it of a peddler and gave it to Vanni,&rdquo;
answered Mary, scared but truthful. &ldquo;You all heard him
say that he did,&rdquo; she added to the bystanders. &ldquo;He told
Vanni to use it in these cakes, but Vanni used the spice you
gave us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen that peddler before,&rdquo; gasped Giovanni. &ldquo;He
tried to bribe me to take the Queen a letter and a packet, and
I would not. I put some of the spice in honey, and the flies
that ate of it died. Then I sent it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a subtle device,&rdquo; said Tomaso slowly. &ldquo;The spice
would disguise the flavor. Every one knew that Giovanni was
to make the cakes, and that the Queen will not come to the
banquet. When it is served do you send each sauce to me
for testing. We will have no poison in the King&rsquo;s dish.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The plot, as Tomaso guessed, had not been born of the
jealousy of a cook, but of subtler brains beyond the seas.
The Queen might well have been held responsible if the poison
had worked. But when she heard of it she wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been loyal,&rdquo; she flung out, in tearful defiance,
&ldquo;but I would not have done that&mdash;never that!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XIII<br />
<br />
A DYKE IN THE DANELAW<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW DAVID LE SAUMOND CHANGED THE COURSE OF AN ANCIENT
NUISANCE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Farmer Appleby</span> was in what he called a fidget.
He did not look nervous, and was not. But the word,
along with several others he sometimes used, had come
down to him from Scandinavian forefathers. The very
name with its ending &ldquo;by&rdquo; showed that his farm was a part
of the Danelaw.</p>

<p>Along the coast, and in the part of England fronting the
North Sea, Danish invaders had imposed their own laws and
customs on the country, and were strong enough to hold their
own even in the face of a Saxon King. It was only a few
years since the Danegeld, the tax collected from all England
to ward off the raids of Danish sea-rovers, had been abolished.
But Ralph Appleby was as good an Englishman as any.</p>

<p>Little by little the Danelaw was yielding to the common
law of England, but that did not worry an Appleby. He
did not trouble the law courts, nor did they molest him. The
cause of his fidget was a certain law of nature by which water
seeks the shortest way down. One side of his farm lay along
the river. Like most of the Danish, Norse, Icelandic or
Swedish colonists, his long-ago ancestor had settled on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
little river in a marsh. First he made camp on an island;
then he built a house on the higher bank. Then the channel
on the near side of the island filled up, and he planted the
rich soil that the river had brought with orchards, and pastured
fat cattle in the meadows. Three hundred years later
the Applebys owned one of the most prosperous farms in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Now and then, however, the river remembered that it had
a claim on that land. The soil, all bound and matted with
tough tree-roots and quitch-grass, could not be washed away,
but the waters took their toll in produce. The year before
the orchards had been flooded and two-thirds of the crop
floated off. A day or two later, when the flood subsided, the
apples were left to fatten Farmer Kettering&rsquo;s hogs, rooting
about on the next farm. Hob Kettering&rsquo;s stubborn little
Saxon face was all a-grin when he met Barty Appleby and told
of it. It speaks well for the friendship of the two boys that
there was not a fight on the spot.</p>

<p>That was not all. The stone dyke between the river and
the lowlands had been undermined by the tearing current, and
must be rebuilt, and there were no stone-masons in the neighborhood.
Each farmer did his own repairing as well as he
could. The houses were of timber, plaster, some brick and
a little rude masonry. There were not enough good masons
in the country to supply the demand, and even in building
castles and cathedrals the stone was sometimes brought, ready
cut, from France. In some parts of England the people used
stone from old Roman walls, or built on old foundations,
but in Roman times this farm had been under water in the
marsh. The building of Lincoln Cathedral meant a procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of stone-barges going up the river loaded with stone for the
walls, quarried in Portland or in France. When landed it was
carried up the steep hill to the site of the building, beyond
reach of floods that might sap foundations. It was slow work
building cathedrals in marsh lands.</p>

<p>The farmer was out in his boat now, poling up and down
along the face of the crumbling wall, trying to figure on the
amount of stone that would be needed. He never picked a
stone out of his fields that was not thrown on a heap for
possible wall-building, but most of them were small. It
would take several loads to replace what the river had stolen&mdash;and
then the whole thing might sink into the mud in a year
or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hech, master!&rdquo; said a voice overhead. &ldquo;Are ye wantin&rsquo; a
stone-mason just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Appleby looked up. On the little bridge, peering
down, was a freckled, high-cheek-boned man with eyes as blue
as his own, and with a staff in one big, hard-muscled hand.
He wore a rough, shabby cloak of ancient fashion and had a
bundle on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say I be,&rdquo; said the surprised farmer. &ldquo;Be you
wanting the job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger was evidently a Scot, from his speech, and
Scots were not popular in England then. Still, if he could
build a wall he was worth day&rsquo;s wages. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer name?&rdquo;
Appleby added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just David,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frae Dunedin.
There&rsquo;s muckle stone work there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I make my guess they&rsquo;ve better stuff for building than
that pile o&rsquo; pebbles,&rdquo; muttered the farmer, leaping ashore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
kicking with his foot the heap of stone on the bank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
built that wall over again three times, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The newcomer grinned, not doubtfully but confidently, as
if he knew exactly what the trouble was. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll mend all
that,&rdquo; he said, striding down to peer along the water-course.
The wriggling stream looked harmless enough now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in England some time?&rdquo; queried Appleby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;I learned my trade overseas and
then I came to the Minster, but I didna stay long. Me and
the master mason couldna make our ideas fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barty, sorting over the stones, gazed awestruck at the stranger.
Such independence was unheard-of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What seemed to be the hitch?&rdquo; asked the farmer coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was too fond o&rsquo; making rubble serve for buildin&rsquo;
stone,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;d face it with Portland ashlars
to deceive the passer-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have no cause to worry over that here,&rdquo; said Ralph
Appleby dryly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not using ashlars or whatever ye call
them, in my orchard wall. Good masonry will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ashlar means a building stone cut and dressed,&rdquo; explained
David. &ldquo;I went along that wall of yours before you came.
If you make a culvert up stream with a stone-arched bridge in
place of the ford yonder, ye&rsquo;ll divert the course of the waters
from your land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I put a bridge over the Wash, I could make a weir to
catch salmon,&rdquo; said the startled farmer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no cut stone
for arches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use good mortar and plenty of it, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
David. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The things that David accomplished with rubble, or miscellaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
scrap-stone, seemed like magic to Barty. He
trotted about at the heels of the mason, got very tired and delightfully
dirty, asked numberless questions, which were always
answered, and considered David the most interesting man
he had ever met. David solved the building-stone problem
by concocting mortar after a recipe of his own and using plenty
of it between selected stones. Sometimes there seemed to be
almost as much mortar as there was stone, but the wedge-shaped
pieces were so fitted that the greater the pressure on
the arch the firmer it would be. Laborers were set to work
digging a channel to let the stream through this gully under
the arches, and it seemed glad to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m a man, David,&rdquo; announced Barty, lying over
the bridge-rail on his stomach and looking down at the waters
that tore through the new channel, &ldquo;I shall be a mason just
like you. The river can&rsquo;t get our apples now, can it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>David grinned. &ldquo;Water never runs up hill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
it will run down hill if it takes a thousand years. You learn
that first, if you want to be a mason, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But everybody knows that,&rdquo; Barty protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two and two mak&rsquo; four, but if you and me had twa
aipples each, and I ate one o&rsquo; mine, and pit the ither with
yours to mak&rsquo; fower and you didna find it out it wad be a sign
ye didna know numbers,&rdquo; retorted David, growing more and
more Scotch as he explained. &ldquo;And when I see a mason lay
twa-three stones to twa-three mair and fill in the core wi&rsquo;
rubble I ken he doesna reckon on the water seeping in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve put rubble in those arches, David,&rdquo; said Barty,
using his eyes to help his argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spandrel, spandrel, ye loon,&rdquo; grunted David. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
learn to be a mason if ye canna mind the names o&rsquo; things.
The space between the arch and the beam&rsquo;s filled wi&rsquo; rubble
and good mortar, but the weight doesna rest on that&mdash;it&rsquo;s
mostly on the arches where we used the best of our stanes.
And there&rsquo;s no great travel ower the brig forbye. It&rsquo;s different
with a cathedral like yon. Ye canna build siccan a mighty
wall wi&rsquo; mortar alone. The water&rsquo;s aye searchin&rsquo; for a place
to enter. When the rocks freeze under the foundations they
crumble where the water turns to ice i&rsquo; the seams. When the
rains come the water&rsquo;ll creep in if we dinna make a place for
it to rin awa&rsquo; doon the wa&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s why we carve the little
drip-channels longways of the arches, ye see. A wall&rsquo;s no
better than the weakest stane in it, lad, and when you&rsquo;ve built
her you guard her day and night, summer and winter, frost,
fire and flood, if you want her to last. And a Minster like
York or Lincoln&mdash;the sound o&rsquo; the hammer about her walls
winna cease till Judgment Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barty looked rather solemnly at the little, solid, stone-arched
bridge, and the stone-walled culvert. While it was
a-building David had explained that if the stream overflowed
here it would be over the reedy meadows near the river,
which would be none the worse for a soaking. The orchards
and farm lands were safe. The work that they had done
seemed to link itself in the boy&rsquo;s mind to cathedral towers and
fortress-castles and the dykes of Flanders of which David
had told.</p>

<p>The loose stone from the ruined wall was used to finish a
wall in a new place, across the corner of the land by which
the river still flowed. This would make a wharf for the
boats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This mortar o&rsquo; yours might ha&rsquo; balked the Flood o&rsquo; Noah,
belike,&rdquo; said Farmer Appleby, when they were mixing the
last lot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasna there, and I canna say,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s
a way to lay the stones that&rsquo;s worth knowing for a job like
this. Let&rsquo;s see if ye ken your lesson, young chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David&rsquo;s amusement at Barty&rsquo;s intense interest in the work
had changed to genuine liking. The boy showed a judgment
in what he did, which pleased the mason. He had always
built walls and dams with the stones he gathered when his
father set him at work. His favorite playground was the
stone-heap. Now he laid selected stones so deftly and skillfully
that the tiny wall he was raising was almost as firm as if
mortar had been used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lay the stones in layers or courses,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;the stretcher stones go lengthwise of the wall and the head-stones
with the end on the face of the wall, and you lay first
one and then the other, &rsquo;cordin&rsquo; as you want them. When
the big stones and the little ones are fitted so that the top
of the layer is pretty level it&rsquo;s coursed rubble, and that&rsquo;s better
than just building anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wey is it better?&rdquo; interposed David.</p>

<p>Barty pondered. &ldquo;It looks better anyhow. And then, if
you want to put cut stone, or beams, on top, you&rsquo;re all ready.
Besides, it takes some practice to lay a wall that way, and
you might as well be practicing all you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men chuckled. A part of this, of course, Farmer
Appleby already knew, but he had never explained to Barty.</p>

<p>The boy went on. &ldquo;The stones ought to be fitted so that
the face of the wall is laid to a true line. If you slope it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
little it&rsquo;s stronger, because that makes it wider at the bottom.
But if you slope it too much the water won&rsquo;t run off and the
snow will lie. If you&rsquo;ve got any big stones put them where
they will do the most good, &rsquo;cause you want the wall to be
strong everywhere. A bigger stone that is pretty square, like
this, can be a bond stone, and if you use one here and there it
holds the wall together. David says the English gener&rsquo;lly
build a stone wall with a row of headers and then a row of
stretchers, but in Flanders they lay a header and then a
stretcher in every row.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many loads of stone will it take for this wall?&rdquo; asked
David. Barty hesitated, measured with his eye, and then
made a guess. &ldquo;How much mortar?&rdquo; He guessed again.
The estimate was so near Farmer Appleby&rsquo;s own figures that
he was betrayed into a whistle of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gey canny for a lad,&rdquo; said David, grinning. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
near as wise as me. We&rsquo;ve been at that game for a month.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Never lat on, but aye lat owre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twa and twa they aye mak&rsquo; fowre.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Barty quoted a rhyme from David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ve earned over and above your pay,&rdquo; said
Farmer Appleby. He foresaw the usefulness of all this lore
when Barty was a little older. The boy could direct a gang
of heavy-handed laborers nearly as well as he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any mason that&rsquo;s worth his salt will dae that,&rdquo; said David,
unconcernedly.</p>

<p>Barty was experimenting with his stone-laying when a
hunting-party of strangers came down the bridle-path from
the fens, where they had been hawking for a day. The fame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of the Appleby culvert had spread through the country, and
people often came to look at it, so that no one was surprised.
The leader of the group was a middle-aged stout man, with
close-clipped reddish hair, a full curly beard and a masterful
way of speaking; he had a bow in his hand, and paced to and
fro restlessly even when he was talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who taught you to build walls, my boy?&rdquo; asked a young
man with bright dark eyes and a citole over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; said Barty. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Scot. When he was in
France they called him David Saumond because of his leaping.
He can dance fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who taught David?&rdquo; inquired the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The birds,&rdquo; Barty answered with a grin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; laughed the minstrel, and Barty sang.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The dove wi&rsquo; her short bill she brought them hame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pyet was a wily bird and bug up the wa&rsquo;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corby was a silly bird and pu&rsquo;d it down ava,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then cam&rsquo; auld Tod Lowrie and skelpit them a&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that, Ranulph?&rdquo; queried the masterful man,
pausing in his walk. Ranulph translated, with a mischievous
twinkle in his eye, for there was more in the song than Barty
knew. Each of the birds stood for one or another of the
Scotch lords who had figured in the recent trouble between
William of Scotland and the English King, and Tod Lowrie
is the popular Scotch name for the red fox. It is not every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
king who cares to hear himself called a fox to his face, even if
he behaves like one. David and Farmer Appleby, coming
through the orchard, were rather aghast.</p>

<p>As they came to a halt, and made proper obeisance to their
superiors, the King addressed David in Norman such as the
common folk used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you hold it folly to pull down a wall? There&rsquo;s not
one stone left on another in Milan since Frederick Barbarossa
took the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ou ay,&rdquo; said David coolly. &ldquo;If he had to build it up again
he&rsquo;d no be so blate, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King laughed and so did the others. &ldquo;I wish I had
had you seven years ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when we dyked the Loire.
There were thirty miles of river bank at Angers, flooded season
after season, when a well-built river wall would have saved
the ruin. A man that can handle rubble in a marsh like this
ought to be doing something better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I learned my trade on that dyke,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;They
Norman priors havena all learned theirs yet. I was at the
Minster yonder, and if I&rsquo;d built my piers like they said, the
water would ha&rsquo; creepit under in ten years&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in ten years, that Prior hopes to be Archbishop without
doubt,&rdquo; said the King with a shrug. &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;Their ashlars are set up for vanity
and to be seen o&rsquo; men. Ye must have regard to the disposition
of the building-stone when ye build for good an&rsquo; all. It
doesna like to be stood up just anyhow. Let it lie as it lay in
the quarry, and it&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barty was watching the group, his blue eyes blazing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the apple-red color flushing his round cheeks. The King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was talking to David as if he were pleased, and David,
though properly respectful, was not in the least afraid. The
Plantagenets were a race of building Kings. They all knew
a master mason when they saw him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you changed the ancient course of the flood into that
culvert, did you?&rdquo; the King inquired, with a glance at the
new channel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;No man can rule the watters of the
heavens, and it&rsquo;s better to dyke a flood than to dam it, if ye
can.&rdquo; The King, with a short laugh, borrowed tablet and
ink-horn from his scribe and made a note or two.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;IT IS TIME TO SET HIM BUILDING FOR ENGLAND&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;When I find a Scotch mason with an English apprentice
building Norman arches in the Danelaw,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;it is
time to set him building for England. I hear that William,
whom they call the Englishman, is at work in Canterbury.
When you want work you may give him this, and by the
sight of God have a care that there is peace among the
building-stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David must have done so, for on one of the stones in a
world-famed cathedral may be seen the mason&rsquo;s mark of
David le Saumond and the fish which is his token.</p>

<h2>XIV<br />
<br />
AT BARTLEMY FAIR<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW BARTY APPLEBY WENT TO THE FAIR AT SMITH FIELD AND
CAUGHT A MISCREANT</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> farmer&rsquo;s life is a very varied one, as any one who
ever lived on a farm is aware. In some seasons the
work is so pressing that the people hardly stop to eat
or sleep. At other times Nature herself takes a hand,
and the farmer has a chance to mend walls, make and repair
harness, clear woodland and do some hedging and ditching
while the land is getting ready for the next harvest. This at
any rate was the way in medieval England, and the latter
part of August between haying and harvest was a holiday time.</p>

<p>Barty Appleby liked Saint Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day, the twenty-fourth
of August, best of all the holidays of the year. It
was the feast of his name-saint, when a cake was baked especially
for him. Yule-tide was a merry season, but to have a
holiday of one&rsquo;s very own was even pleasanter.</p>

<p>On the day that he was twelve years old Barty was to
have a treat which all the boys envied him. He was to go to
Bartlemy Fair at Smithfield by London. David Saumond,
the stone-mason who had built their orchard-wall, was going
beyond London to Canterbury to work at the cathedral.
Farmer Appleby had a sister living in London, whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
not seen for many years, and by this and by that he decided
to go with David as far as London Bridge.</p>

<p>The Fairs held on one and another holiday during the year
were great markets for Old England. Nearly all of them
were called after some Saint. It might be because the saint
was a patron of the guild or industry which made the fair
prosperous; Saint Blaize was the patron of the wool-combers,
Saint Eloy of the goldsmiths, and so on. It was often simply
a means of making known the date. People might not know
when the twenty-ninth of September came, if they could not
read; but they were very likely to know how long it was to
Saint Michael&rsquo;s Day, or Michaelmas, because the quarter&rsquo;s
rent was due at that time. June 24, the Feast of Saint John
the Baptist, was Midsummer Quarter Day, and in every month
there were several saints&rsquo; days which one or another person
in any neighborhood had good cause for remembering.</p>

<p>St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Fair at London was one of the greatest
of all, and its name came about in an interesting way. Barty
knew the story by heart. The founder was Rahere, the jester
of Henry&nbsp;I. While on pilgrimage to Rome he had fallen ill
in a little town outside the city, and being near death had
prayed to Saint Bartholomew, who was said to have been a
physician, for help. The saint, so the legend goes, appeared to
him in a vision and told him to found a church and a hospital.
He was to have no misgiving, but go forward with the work
and the way would be made clear. Coming back to England
he told the story to the King, who gave him land in a waste
marshy place called Smoothfield, outside London, where the
wall turned inward in a great angle. He got the foundations
laid by gathering beggars, children and half-witted wanderers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
about him and making a jest of the hard work. The fields
were like the kind of place where a circus-tent is pitched now.
Horses and cattle were brought there to market, as it was
convenient both to the roads outside and the gates of the city.
The church walls rose little by little, as the King and others
became interested in the work, and in course of time Rahere
gathered a company of Augustines there and became prior of
the monastery. The hospital built and tended by these monks
was the first in London. In 1133 Rahere persuaded the King
to give him a charter for a three days&rsquo; Fair of Saint Bartholomew
in the last week of August, and tradition says that he
used sometimes to go out and entertain the crowds with jests
and songs. Rahere&rsquo;s Norman arches are still to be seen in
Saint Bartholomew&rsquo;s Church in London, close by the street
that is called the Cloth Fair.</p>

<p>The Fair grew and prospered, for it had everything in its
favor. It came at a time of year when traveling was good,
it was near the horse-market, which every farmer would want
to visit, it was near London on the other hand, so that merchants
English and foreign could come out to sell their goods,
and it had close by the church and the hospital, which received
tolls, or a percentage as it would be called to-day, on the
profits.</p>

<p>Barty had heard of the Fair ever since he could remember,
for almost every year some one in the neighborhood went.
Very early in the morning the little party set forth, and Barty
kissed his mother and the younger ones good-by, feeling very
important. He rode behind David, and two serving men
came with them to take care of the horses and luggage. Farmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Appleby was taking two fine young horses to market, and
some apples and other oddments to his sister Olive.</p>

<p>They trotted along the narrow lane at a brisk pace and presently
reached the high road. After that there was much to
see. All sorts of folk were wending to the Fair.</p>

<p>The fairs, all over England, were the goal of foreign traders
and small merchants of every kind, who could not afford to
set up shop in a town. In many cases the tolls of the Fair
went to the King, to some Abbey, or to one of the Guilds.
The law frequently obliged the merchants in the neighboring
town or city to close their shops while the Fair lasted. The
townsfolk made holiday, or profited from the more substantial
customers who came early and stayed late with friends.</p>

<p>Barty heard his father and David discussing these and
other laws as they rode. For David, as a stranger in the
country, all such matters were of interest, although a member
of the Masons&rsquo; Guild could travel almost anywhere in the
days of constant building. No stranger might remain in London
more than one night. The first night he stayed in any
man&rsquo;s house he might be regarded as a stranger, but if he
stayed a second night he was considered the guest of the house-holder,
and after that he was to be held a member of the household,
for whom his host was responsible. Wandering tradesmen
would have had a hard time of it without the Fairs. On
a pinch, a traveling merchant who sold goods at a fair could
sleep in his booth or in the open air.</p>

<p>The law did not affect the Appleby party. Barty&rsquo;s Aunt
Olive was married to Swan Petersen, a whitesmith or worker in
tin, and she lived outside the wall, close to the church of Saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Clement of the Danes. When they reached London they
would lodge under her roof.</p>

<p>They stayed at an inn the first night on the road, and
slept on the floor wrapped in their good woolen cloaks, for
the place was crowded. During the hour after supper Barty,
perched on a barrel in the court-yard, saw jongleurs and
dancers, with bells on head and neck and heels, capering in the
flare of the torches. He heard a minstrel sing a long ballad
telling the story of Havelok the Dane, which his mother had
told him. His father and David gave each a penny to these
entertainers, and Barty felt as content as any boy would, on
the way to London with money in his pocket for fairings.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the next day the crowd was so dense
that they had to ride at a snail&rsquo;s pace in dust and turmoil, and
Barty grew so tired that he nearly tumbled off. David, with
a chuckle, lifted the boy around in front of him, and when
they reached London after the closing of the gates, and turned
to the right toward the little village founded by the Danes,
they had to shake Barty awake at Swan Petersen&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>Aunt Olive, a trim, fresh-faced, flaxen-haired woman,
laughed heartily as the sleepy boy stumbled in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How late you are, brother!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And this is David
Saumond, by whom you sent a message last year. Well, it
is good to see you. And how are they all at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barty was awake next morning almost as soon as the pigeons
were, and peering out of the window he saw David, already
out and surveying the street. The boy tumbled into his
clothes and down the stairs, and went with David to look
about while Farmer Appleby and his sister told the news
and unpacked the good things from the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fleet River was crowded with ships of the lesser sort,
and the Thames itself was more than twice as broad as it is
to-day. Barty wanted to see London Bridge at once, but
that was some distance away, and so was London Tower.
The tangle of little lanes around the Convent Garden was
full of braying donkeys, bawling drivers, cackling poultry and
confusion. In Fair-time there was a general briskening of all
trade for miles around. At Charing village David hailed a
boatman, and all among the swans and other water-fowl, the
barges and sailing craft, they went down to London Bridge.</p>

<p>Barty had asked any number of questions about this bridge
when David returned from London the previous year, but
as often happens, the picture he had formed in his mind was
not at all like the real thing. It was a wooden bridge, but the
beginnings of stone piers could be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve put Peter de Colechurch at that job,&rdquo; said David.
&ldquo;He has a vision of a brig o&rsquo; stanes, and swears it shall come
true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will?&rdquo; asked Barty soberly. The vast
river as he looked to right and left seemed a mighty creature
for one man to yoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in his time, happen, but some day it will,&rdquo; David
answered as they shot under the middle arch. &ldquo;And yon&rsquo;s
the Tower!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barty felt as if he had seen enough for the day already
as he gazed up at the great square keep among the lesser
buildings, jutting out into the river as if to challenge all
comers. However, there was never a boy who could not go
on sight-seeing forever. By the time they had returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Fleet Street he had tucked away the Tower and London
Bridge in his mind and was ready for the Fair.</p>

<p>The Fair was a city of booths, of tents, of sheds and of
awnings. Bunyan described the like in Vanity Fair. Cloth-sellers
from Cambrai, Paris, Ypres, Arras and other towns
where weavers dwelt, had a street to themselves, and so did
the jewelers. The jewelry was made more for show than
worth, and there were gay cords for lacing bodices or shoes,
and necklaces that were called &ldquo;tawdrey chains&rdquo; from the
fair of St. Etheldreda or Saint Audrey, where they were first
sold. There were glass beads and perfume-bottles from Venice;
there were linens of Damietta, brocaded stuff from Damascus,
veils and scarfs from Moussoul&mdash;or so they were said
to be. Shoes of Cordovan leather were there also, spices, and
sweetmeats, herbs and cakes.</p>

<p>Old-fashioned people call machine-sawed wooden borders
on porches &ldquo;gingerbread work.&rdquo; The gingerbread sold by old
Goody Raby looked very much like them. She had gingerbread
horses, and men, and peacocks, and monkeys, gingerbread
churches and gingerbread castles, gingerbread kings and
queens and saints and dragons and elephants, although the
elephant looked rather queer. They were made of a spicy
yellow-brown dough rolled into thin sheets, cut into shapes,
baked hard and then gilded here and there. The king&rsquo;s crown,
the peacock&rsquo;s head and neck, the castle on the elephant&rsquo;s
back, were gilded. Barty bought a horse for himself and a
small menagerie of animals for the younger children at home.</p>

<p>A boy not much older than himself was selling perfume in
a tiny corner. It struck Barty that here might be something
that his mother would like, and he pulled at Aunt Olive&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
sleeve and asked her what she thought. She agreed with him,
and they spent some pleasant minutes choosing little balls of
perfumed wax, which could be carried in a box or bag, or laid
away in chests. There was something wholesome and refreshing
about the scent, and Barty could not make up his mind
what flower it was like. The boy said that several kinds were
used in the making of each perfume, and that he had helped
in the work. He said that his name was &ldquo;Vanni,&rdquo; which Barty
thought a very queer one, but this name, it appeared, was the
same as John in his country. Barty himself would be called
there Bartolomeo.</p>

<p>Vanni seemed to be known to many of the people at the
fair. A tall, brown young fellow with a demure dark-eyed
girl on his arm stopped and asked him how trade was, and so
did a young man in foreign dress who spoke to him in his
own language. This young man was presently addressed as
&ldquo;Matteo,&rdquo; by a gayly clad troubadour, and Barty, with a
jump, recognized the young man who had been with the King
when he came to look at their dyke. One of the reasons
why almost everybody came to Bartlemy Fair was that almost
everybody did. It was a place where people who seldom
crossed each other&rsquo;s path were likely to meet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Vanni caught anything yet?&rdquo; the troubadour asked
in that language which Barty did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; the other answered, &ldquo;but he will. Set a weasel
to catch a rat.&rdquo; And the two laughed and parted.</p>

<p>But it was Barty who really caught the rat they were talking
about. A man with a performing bear had stopped just there
and a crowd had gathered about him. Barty had seen that
bear the night before, and he could not see over the heads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the men, in any case. A stout elderly merchant trying to
make his way through the narrow lanes, fumed and fretted
and became wedged in. Barty saw a thin, shabby-faced fellow
duck under a big drover&rsquo;s arm, cut a long slit in the stout man&rsquo;s
purse that hung at his belt, and slip through the crowd. Just
then some one raised a cry that the bear was loose, and everything
was confusion. Barty&rsquo;s wit and boldness blocked the
thief&rsquo;s game. He tripped the man up with David&rsquo;s staff, and
with a flying jump, landed on his shoulders. It was a risky
thing to do, for the man had a knife and could use it, but
Barty was the best wrestler in his village, and a minute later
David had nabbed the rascal and recovered the plunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, my lad, thank ye,&rdquo; said the merchant, and hurried
away. The boy Vanni swept all his goods into a basket
and after one look at the thief was off like a shot. Presently
up came two or three men in the livery of the King&rsquo;s officers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Farmer Appleby and his sister came up, having
seen the affair from a little distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My faith,&rdquo; said Aunt Olive indignantly, &ldquo;he might have
spared a penny or two for your trouble. That was Gamelyn
Bouverel, one of the richest goldsmiths in Chepe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; laughed Barty, &ldquo;it was good sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that was not to be the end of it. They were on their
way to the roast-pig booth where cooked meat could be had
hot from the fire, when a young Londoner came toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the lad who saved my uncle&rsquo;s purse for him,&rdquo; he
said in a relieved tone. &ldquo;I thought I had lost you in the crowd.
Here is a fairing for you,&rdquo; and he slipped a silver groat into
Barty&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that is more like a Christian,&rdquo; observed Aunt Olive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
But Barty was meditating about something, and he was rather
silent all through dinner. Besides the hot roast, they bought
bread, and Barty had his new &ldquo;Bartlemy knife&rdquo; with which
to cut his slice of the roast. A costard-monger sold them
apples, and the seeds were carefully saved for planting at
home. Then they must all see a show, and they crowded into
a tent and saw a play acted by wooden marionettes in a toy
theater, like a Punch and Judy. In the Cloth Fair the farmer
bought fine Flemish cloth for the mother, dyed a beautiful
blue, and red cloth for a cloak for Hilda. While Aunt Olive
was helping to choose this Barty slipped across the way and
looked for Vanni. He had heard Vanni tell the men that the
thief&rsquo;s name was Conrad Waibling. Rascals were a new thing
in Barty&rsquo;s experience. There was nobody in the village at
home who would deliberately hem in a man by a crowd and
then rob him. Barty was sure that the man with the performing
bear was in it as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanni,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know that thief that they caught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vanni nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that the man with the dancing bear was a
friend of his?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he was,&rdquo; said Vanni grimly. &ldquo;He escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barty hesitated. &ldquo;What do you think they will do to the
one that they caught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be punished,&rdquo; answered Vanni coolly. &ldquo;He is a
poisoner. He has sold poisoned spices&mdash;for pay. I think he
failed, and did not poison anybody, so that he has had to get
his living where he could. He is finished now&mdash;ended&mdash;no
more.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Barty felt rather cold. Vanni was so matter-of-fact about
it. The Italian boy saw the look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;so bad as betraying your salt&mdash;you
understand&mdash;to live in a man&rsquo;s house and kill him secretly&mdash;to
give him food which is death. There are places
where no man can trust his neighbor. You do not know what
they are like. Your father is his own man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barty felt that he had seen a great deal in the world since he
left the farm in the Danelaw. He was glad to go with his
father and Aunt Olive and David into the stately quiet church.
The Prior of the monastery&mdash;Rahere had long been dead&mdash;was
a famous preacher, Aunt Olive said, and often preached
sermons in rhyme. They went through the long airy quiet
rooms of the hospital where the monks were tending sick men,
or helping them out into the sun. As they came out, past the
box for offerings, and each gave something, Barty left there
his silver groat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather Saint Bartlemy had it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h2>XV<br />
<br />
EDWITHA&rsquo;S LITTLE BOWL<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW EDWITHA FOUND ROMAN POTTERY IN THE FIELD OF A
SUSSEX FARM</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Under</span> a hawthorn bush, near a white road leading
up a hill, in sight of a thatch-roofed farmhouse, two
little girls were playing house. Their names were
Edwitha and Audrey, and they were cousins. Audrey&rsquo;s
father lived in the farmhouse and kept sheep on the
Downs, and Edwitha had also lived there nearly all her life.
Her father had been lost at sea, and her mother had brought
her back to the old home, and died not long after. The two
girls had grown up like sisters, for the farmer was not a man
who did things by halves, and when he adopted his brother&rsquo;s
orphan child he made her his own.</p>

<p>The two children were almost exactly of a size, and within
a year of the same age; and both had the milky skin and rose-pink
cheeks which make English children look so like flowers.
But Audrey&rsquo;s hair was yellow as ripe wheat, and Edwitha&rsquo;s
was brown like an oak-leaf in autumn; Audrey&rsquo;s eyes were
gray, and Edwitha&rsquo;s were dark and dreamy. They wore
homespun linen gowns off the same web of watchet blue, and
little clumsy leather shoes like sandals, made by the village
shoemaker. This particular place was their favorite playhouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
There were two hollows, like dimples in the hill, and
the bush bent over one like a roof, while the other had been
roofed over by a neighbor-lad, Wilfrid. He had stuck saplings
into the ground, bent the tops over and woven branches
in and out to hold them. They took root and came out in
fine leaf. Wilfrid had seen something like it in a garden,
where a walk was roofed in this way and called a &ldquo;pleached
alley.&rdquo; It looked like a bird&rsquo;s nest built on the ground, but it
was a very nice little bower.</p>

<p>At this particular hour they were making ready for a feast,
setting out the eatables on all their best bits of crockery.
Whatever was broken in the house was likely to come to them,
and besides this, they found a good many pieces of pottery of
different kinds on the farm. This had been, a thousand years
before, a part of a Roman governor&rsquo;s country estate. When
the men were plowing they often turned up scraps of bronze,
tiles, or dishes that had been all that time buried in the earth.</p>

<p>Edwitha was especially fond of the tiles; and she had collected
almost enough of them to make a little hearth. The
one she intended for the middle had a picture in colors of a
little brown rabbit sitting on the grass, nibbling a carrot, with
a blue flower and a yellow one growing close by. It was almost
whole&mdash;only one corner was broken.</p>

<p>Edwitha&rsquo;s dishes were nearly all of the old Roman ware.
The fragments were deep red, and some had little black figures
and decorations on them. No two fitted together, and
there were no pieces large enough for her to make out what
the dish had been like. She used to wonder what sort of people
had used those dishes, and whether they lived very differently
from the Sussex people who came after them. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
seemed as if they must have. No dishes made nowadays had
any such appearance.</p>

<p>Audrey did not care about such matters. She preferred a
bowl and jug she had which came from the pottery, and were
whole, and would hold milk and honey. When the two girls
ate their dinner in their bower, as they sometimes did, they
used little wooden bowls with horn spoons.</p>

<p>Wilfrid was the only person Edwitha knew, besides herself,
who was at all interested in the unearthed pottery. He had
brought her some of the best pieces she had, and had asked
the priest at the village whether he knew who made such
things. Father Cuthbert knew that there had been Romans
in England, and he told Wilfrid some Roman history, but
there was nothing in it about the way in which the Romans
really lived.</p>

<p>The very road that ran past the bower had been made by
the Romans. It gave its name to the farm&mdash;Borstall Farm.
It was a track cut deep into the chalk of the hill, not more
than ten feet wide, leading to the camp which had once been
on the top of the Down. Nothing was there now but the
sheep and the gorse and the short, sweet grass of the Downs.
On a level terrace-like break in the hillside, overlooking the
valley, a Roman villa had stood, a great house with white
porticoes, marble columns, tiled floors and painted walls.
Mosaic pictures of the gods had been a part of its decorations,
and if any one had known it, those buried gods were under the
hillside quite uninjured&mdash;so firm and strong was the Roman
cement, and so thorough the work. Hundreds of guests and
relatives and servants had come and gone in the stately palace
of the provincial Governor; the farm lands around it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
tilled by hundreds of peasants in its two hundred years of
splendor. No wonder there were so many fragments! A
great many dishes can be broken in two centuries.</p>

<p>Pincher, the old sheep-dog, had been invited to the feast
in the bower, but when it was ready he was busy elsewhere.
Edwitha went looking for him, and after she had called several
times she heard his answering &ldquo;Wuff! Wuff!&rdquo; and caught
sight of him down among the brambles at the boundary-line
of the next farmstead. He came leaping toward her, and as
she looked at the place where he had been, she saw that a piece
of the bank had slid into a rabbit-burrow, and something red
was sticking out of the earth. It was a little red bowl.</p>

<p>No such bowls are made in these days. They are never
seen except on a shelf in some museum. Wise men have
called them &ldquo;Samian ware,&rdquo; because they have been found on
the island of Samos, but as some of this ware has been found
wherever the Romans went in Gaul or Britain, it would seem
that they must have had some secret process in their potteries
and made it out of ordinary clay.</p>

<p>The bowl was deep red, and beautifully smooth. Around
it was a band of little dancing figures in jet black, so lifelike
that it almost seemed as if such figures might come out of the
copse and dance away down the hill. Edwitha took some
leaves and rubbed off the clay that stuck to the bowl, and the
cleaner she made it the prettier it was. Very carefully she carried
it back to the bower to show Audrey.</p>

<p>Half way there, a dreadful thought came to her. What if
Audrey should want the bowl? It was quite perfect&mdash;the
only whole one they had found&mdash;and Audrey always liked
things that were whole, not broken or nicked, better than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sort of imperfect ones. Certainly they could not both have it.</p>

<p>Edwitha came to a stop, and stood quite still, thinking
about it. She knew a place, under the roots of an old tree,
where she could keep the bowl, and go and look at it when
she was alone, and no one would know that she had it. If
Audrey wanted the bowl, and took it, she might let it get
broken, and then she would be willing that Edwitha should
have it; but that would be worse than not having it at all.
Edwitha felt as if she could not bear to have anything happen
to the pretty thing. It already seemed like something alive&mdash;like
a strange, mute person whom nobody understood but herself.
She was the only person who really wanted it, and she
knew that it wanted her.</p>

<p>But under these thoughts which pushed unbidden into Edwitha&rsquo;s
mind was her own feeling that it was a meanness even
to think them. She and Audrey had all their lives done things
together, and Audrey always shared. She always played fair.</p>

<p>Edwitha took the bowl in both hands and walked straight
and very fast up to the bower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Audrey,&rdquo; she said, holding out the bowl, &ldquo;see what I
found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Audrey looked at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like your other dishes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she commented.
&ldquo;Only it is whole. It is just the thing for the dewberries.
They will be prettier than in the basket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwitha set the bowl in the middle of the table and poured
the shining dark fruit into it. It did look pretty, and it had
a mat of green oak-leaves under it which made it prettier still.
Audrey began sticking white blossoms round the edge to set off
the red and green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you found it,&rdquo; she added placidly; &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t
one dish that is quite whole, and I have a blue one, and a white
one, and a jug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwitha touched the bowl caressingly with the tips of her
fingers. &ldquo;I will try to find another for you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you find any more,&rdquo; answered Audrey, pushing Pincher
away from the dish of cold meat, &ldquo;you can have them. I&rsquo;d
rather have our dishes in sets, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwitha was poking about in the bank where she had found
the bowl, late that afternoon, when Wilfrid came up the bank.
There seemed to be no more dishes in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; asked Wilfrid. He held it up in
the sunlight, and drew a quick breath of delight. <a href="#ill14">&ldquo;How
beautiful it is!&rdquo; he exclaimed</a> in a low voice.</p>

<p>Edwitha was silent. She was filled with a great happiness
because she had the bowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how it came to be here,&rdquo; mused Wilfrid, and fell
to digging and prodding the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another in the hole,&rdquo; said Edwitha. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
here a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the only bit I ever saw that was found just
here. But see here, Edwitha, this is clay. It is exactly like
the clay they use at the pottery down by the ford, but finer&mdash;I
think. I tell you&mdash;I believe there was a pottery here once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He and Edwitha took the bowl and a few lumps of the clay,
next morning, to the Master Potter beyond the village. Wilfrid
had served his apprenticeship at this pottery and was now
a journeyman. The clay proved to be finer and more workable
than that near the pottery, and the deposit was close to
the high road, so that donkeys and pack-horses could come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
easily to be loaded with their earthen pots. It was even possible,
so the Master Potter said, that it would make a better
grade of ware than they had been able to make hitherto.
Finally, and most important from the point of view of Wilfrid
and Edwitha, it was on Wilfrid&rsquo;s own farm, he had his old
mother to support, and this discovery might make it possible
for him to have his own pottery and be a Master Potter.</p>

<p>Edwitha often wished that the bowl could speak, and tell
her how it was made, and who drew the little dancing figures.
In course of time Wilfrid tried some experiments with pottery,
ornamenting it with figures in white clay on the colored ground,
and searching continually for new and better methods of glazing,
baking, and modeling his wares. At last, when the years
of his apprenticeship had all been served, and he knew everything
that was taught in the old Sussex pottery by the ford,
he came one spring twilight to the farmhouse and found Edwitha
in the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; he said, half-laughing. &ldquo;I shall never be
content to settle down here until I have seen what they are
doing in other lands. If there is anywhere a man who can
make things like that bowl of yours, I must learn what he can
teach me. It may be that the secret has been lost&mdash;if it has, I
will come back and work here again. A man was never meant
to do less than his best, Edwitha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Edwitha. &ldquo;Those figures make me feel so
too. They always did. I don&rsquo;t want to live anywhere but
here&mdash;and now Audrey has gone away, uncle and aunt could
never do without me&mdash;but I wish we could make beautiful
things in England.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the clever ones are in England,&rdquo; Wilfrid answered.
&ldquo;They are doing good work in glass, I know, and in
carven stone, and some other things, but that is mostly for the
rich abbeys. I shall never be aught but a potter&mdash;but I will
be as good a one as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore Wilfrid took scrip and staff and went on pilgrimage
to France, and there he saw things which made him
sure that men had not lost the love of beauty out of the world.
But he could hear of no master potters who made anything
like the deep red Roman ware. After a year of wandering he
came back, full of new plans, and with many tales to tell;
but he told Edwitha that in all his travels he had seen nothing
which was better worth looking at than her little Roman bowl.</p>

<h2>XVI<br />
<br />
LOOMS IN MINCHEN LANE<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW CORNELYS BAT, THE FLEMISH WEAVER, BEFRIENDED A
BLACK SHEEP AND SAVED HIS WOOL</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was in the early springtime, when lambs are frisking like
rabbits upon the tender green grass, and all the land is
like a tapestry of blue and white and gold and pink and
green. Robert Edrupt, as he rode westward from London
on his homeward way, felt that he had never loved his country
quite so well as now. He had gone with a flock of English
sheep to northern Spain, and come back in the same ship with
the Spanish jennets which the captain took in exchange. On
one of those graceful half-Arabian horses he was now riding,
and on another, a little behind him, rode a swarthy, black-haired
and black-eyed youngster in a sheepskin tunic, who
looked about him as if all that he saw were strange.</p>

<p>In truth Cimarron, as they called him, was very like a wild
sheep from his native Pyrenees, and Edrupt was wondering,
with some amusement and a little apprehension, what his
grandmother and Barbara would say. The boy had been his
servant in a rather dangerous expedition through the mountains,
and but for his watchfulness and courage the English
wool-merchant might not have come back alive. Edrupt had
been awakened between two and three in the morning and told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that robbers were on their trail, and then, abandoning their
animals, Cimarron had led him over a precipitous cliff and
down into the next valley by a road which he and the wild
creatures alone had traveled. When the horses were led on
shipboard the boy had come with them, and London was no
place to leave him after that.</p>

<p>They rode up the well-worn track into the yard of Longley
Farm, and leaving the horses with his attendant, Edrupt went
to find his family. Dame Lysbeth was seated in her chair by
the window, spinning, and would have sent one of the maids
to call the mistress of the house, but Edrupt shook his head.
He said that he would go look for Barbara himself.</p>

<p>He found her kneeling on the turf tending a motherless
lamb, and it was a good thing that the lamb had had nearly all
it could drink already, for when Barbara looked up and saw
who was coming the rest of the milk was spilled. She looked
down, laughing and blushing, presently, at the hem of her
russet gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheep take a deal o&rsquo; mothering,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;well-nigh
as much as men. Come and see the new-born lambs, Robert,
will &rsquo;ee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert stroked the head of the old sheep-dog that had come
up for his share of petting. &ldquo;Here is a black sheep for thee
to mother, sweetheart,&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s of a
breed that is new in these parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara looked at the rough, unkempt young stranger, with
surprise but no unkindness in her eyes. She was not easily
upset, and however wild he looked, the new-comer had been
brought by Robert, and that was all that concerned her.
&ldquo;Where did tha find him, and what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; she inquired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Edrupt laughed again, in proud satisfaction this time; he
might have known that Barbara would behave just in that
way. He explained, and Cimarron was forthwith shown a
corner of a loft where he might sleep, and introduced to Don
the collie as a shepherd in good standing. He and the sheep-dog
seemed to understand each other almost at once, and
though one was almost as silent as the other, they became excellent
comrades.</p>

<p>Besides the sheep, Cimarron seemed interested in but one
thing on the farm, and that was the old loom which had belonged
to Dame Garland and still stood in the weaving-chamber,
where he slept. Dame Lysbeth, rummaging there for
some flax that she wanted, found the boy sitting on the bench
with one bare foot on the treadle, studying the workings of
the clumsy machine. It was a &ldquo;high-warp&rdquo; loom, in which the
web is vertical, and in the loom-chamber where Barbara&rsquo;s
maids spun and wove, Edrupt had set up a Flemish &ldquo;low-warp&rdquo;
loom with all the latest fittings. Into that place the
herd-boy had never ventured. But Dame Lysbeth saw with
surprise that he seemed to understand this loom quite well.
When he was asked, he said that he had seen weaving done on
such a loom in his country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert will be surprised,&rdquo; said Barbara thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Who ever saw a lad like that who cared about weaving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Edrupt was not as mystified as the women were. He
thought it quite possible that the dark young stranger might
have come of some Eastern race which had made weaving an
art beyond anything the West could do. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said
one morning, &ldquo;that I will take him to London and let him try
what he can do in Cornelys Bat&rsquo;s factory.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Cornelys Bat was a Flemish weaver who had come to London
some months before and set up his looms in an old wool-storeroom
outside London Wall. He was a very skillful workman,
but Flanders had weavers enough to supply half Europe
with clothing, and his own town of Arras was already known
for its tapestries. The Lowlands were overcrowded, and there
was not bread enough to go around. Edrupt, whom he had
known for several years, helped him to settle himself in England,
and he had met with almost immediate success. Now
he had with him not only his old parents, a younger brother
and sister and an aunt with her two children, but three neighbors
who also found life hard in populous Flanders. He felt
that he had done well in following Edrupt&rsquo;s advice, &ldquo;When
the wool won&rsquo;t come to you, go where the wool is.&rdquo; He was
a square-built, placid, light-haired man with a stolid expression
that sometimes misled people. When Edrupt came to him
with a strange new apprentice, he readily consented to give
the boy a chance. It was the only chance that there was, for
the Weavers&rsquo; Guild would not have had him.</p>

<p>After a while Cimarron, or Zamaroun as the other &rsquo;prentices
called him, was promoted from porter to draw-boy, as the
weaver&rsquo;s assistant was termed. This work did not need skill,
exactly, but it did demand strength and close attention. The
boy from the Pyrenees was as strong as a young ox, and he
was never tired of watching the work and seeing exactly how
it was done. His silent, quick strength suited Cornelys Bat.
Weaving is work which needs the constant thought of the
weaver, especially when the work is tapestry, and just at
present the Flemings had secured an order for a set of tapestries
for one of the King&rsquo;s country houses. Henry&nbsp;II. was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
continually traveling that the King of France once petulantly
observed that he must fly like a bird through the air to be in
so many places during the year. He had a way of mixing
sport with state affairs, and a week spent in some palace like
Woodstock or Clarendon might be divided evenly between
his lawyers and his hunting-dogs. It is also said of him that
he never forgot a face or a fact once brought to his notice.
Perhaps he learned more on his hunting trips than any one
imagined.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill15.png" width="400" height="270" alt="HIGH-WARP LOOM and LOW-WARP LOOM" title="Click on names below for larger images" />
<span class="caption"><a href="images/ill15a-h.png">HIGH-WARP LOOM</a><span class="sp">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="images/ill15b-h.png">LOW-WARP LOOM</a></span>
</div>

<p>The tapestry weaving was far more complex and difficult
than anything done by Barbara Edrupt&rsquo;s maids. The loom
used by the Flemings was a &ldquo;low-warp&rdquo; loom, in which the
web is horizontal. When the heavy timbers were set up they
were mortised together, that is, a projection in one fitted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a hollow in another, dovetailing them together without nails.
Wooden pegs fitted into holes, and thus the frame, in all its
parts, could be taken to pieces and carried from place to place
on pack-horses if necessary. An ordinary loom was about
eight feet long and perhaps four feet wide, the web usually
being not more than a yard wide, and more commonly twenty-three
or four inches. Broadcloth was woven in those days,
but not very commonly, for it needed a specially constructed
loom and two weavers, one for each side, because of the width
of the cloth. In tapestry weaving the picture was made in
strips, as a rule, and sewed together.</p>

<p>The idea of tapestry weaving in the early part of the Middle
Ages was to tell a story. Few colors were used, and instead of
making one large picture, which would have been very difficult
with the looms then in use, the tapestries were made in sets,
in which a series of pictures from some legends or chronicle
could be shown. When in place, they were wall-coverings
hung loosely from great iron hooks over which rings were
slipped, or hangings for state beds, or sometimes a strip of
tapestry was hung above the carved choir-stalls of a church,
horizontally, to add a touch of color to the gray walls. When
a court moved, or there was a festival day in the church, these
woven or embroidered hangings could be taken from one place
to another. Many tapestries were embroidered by hand,
which was easier for the ordinary woman than weaving a picture,
but took far more time. Kings and noblemen who had
money to spend on such things would order sets of tapestry
woven by such skilled workmen as Cornelys Bat and his Flemings,
or the monks of Saumur in France, or the weavers of
Poitiers. In Sicily, these hangings were often made of silk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
for silk was already made there. Gold and silver thread was
used sometimes, both in weaving and embroidery. Wool, however,
was very satisfactory, not only because it was less costly
than silk, but because it took dye well and made a web of rich
soft colors. It was this which had drawn Robert Edrupt into
Flanders to see what the weavers there were about, what sort
of wool they used, and what the outlook was for their work.
In Cornelys Bat he had found a man who could tell him very
nearly all that there was to know about weaving.</p>

<p>Yet weaving is a craft of so many possibilities and complexities
that a man may spend his whole life at it and still
feel himself only a learner. The master weaver liked Cimarron
because the boy never chattered, but kept his whole mind
on his work. When Cornelys was revolving some new combination
or design in his head, his drawboy was as silent as the
weaver&rsquo;s beam, and the whirr and clack of the loom were the
only sounds in the place.</p>

<p>The weaver at such a loom sat at one end on a little board,
with the heavy roller or weaver&rsquo;s beam on which the warp,
the lengthwise thread, was fastened in front of him. At the
far end of the frame was another roller, the warp being
stretched taut between the two. As the work progressed the
web was rolled up gradually toward the weaver, and the pattern,
if there was one, lay under the warp and was rolled up
on a separate roller. Every skilled weaver had a number of
simple patterns in his head, as a knitter has, but for a tapestry
picture a pattern was drawn and colored on parchment ruled
in squares, and a duplicate pattern made without the color,
showing all the arrangement of the threads and used in &ldquo;gating&rdquo;
as the arrangement of the warp in the beginning was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
called. Every weaver had his own way of gating, and his own
little tricks of weaving. It was a craft that gave a chance for
any amount of ingenuity.</p>

<p>In plain, &ldquo;tabby&rdquo; or &ldquo;taffety&rdquo; weaving, the weft or woof,
the crosswise thread, went in and out exactly as in darning,
and the two treadles underneath the web, worked by the feet,
lifted alternately the odd threads and the even threads, the
weaver tossing the shuttle from hand to hand between them.
At each stroke of the shuttle the swinging beam, or batten, beat
up the weft to make a close, firm, even weave. The shuttle,
made of boxwood and shaped like a little boat, held in its
hollow the &ldquo;quill&rdquo; or bobbin carrying the weft. When all the
&ldquo;yarn,&rdquo; as thread for weaving was always called, was wound
off, the weaver fastened on the end of the next thread with
what is even now called a &ldquo;weaver&rsquo;s knot.&rdquo; As the side of the
web toward him was the wrong side of the cloth, no knot was
allowed to show on the right side.</p>

<p>In brocaded, figured or tapestry weaving, leashes or loops
called heddles were hung from above and lifted whatever part
of the warp they were attached to. For example, three threads
out of ten in the warp could be lifted by one group of heddles
with one motion of the treadle, the heddles being grouped or
&ldquo;harnessed&rdquo; to make this possible. It can be seen that in
weaving by hand a tapestry with perhaps forty or fifty figures
and animals, besides flowers and trees, the most convenient
arrangement of the heddles called for brains as well as skill
of hand in the weaver who did the work. The drawboy&rsquo;s work
was to pull each set of cords in regular order forward and
downward. These cords had to raise a weight of about thirty-six
pounds, which the boy must hold for perhaps a third of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
minute while the ground was woven. He was in a way a part
of the machine, but a part which had a brain.</p>

<p>A ratchet on the roller which held the finished web kept it
from slipping back and held the warp stretched firm at that
end, and in some looms there was a ratchet on the other roller
as well. But Cornelys Bat preferred weights at the far end of
the warp. These allowed the warp to give a tiny bit at every
blow of the batten and then drew it instantly taut, no matter
how heavy the box was made. &ldquo;This kindly giving,&rdquo; explained
the weaver, &ldquo;preventeth the breaking of the slender
threads. No law may be kept too straitly and no thread drawn
too strictly. That is a part of the craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cornelys may have been thinking of something more than
weaving when he made that observation. The quiet tapissiers
of Arras had caused an uproar in the Guild of London Weavers.
A few cool heads advised the others to live and let live.
The Flemings would be good English folk in time, and whatever
they knew would help the craft in the future. But others,
forgetting that they had refused to let their sons serve apprenticeship
to Cornelys Bat when he came, railed at him for
taking Flemings, Gascons, Florentines and even a vagabond
from nobody knew where, into his employ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have no black sheep in our fold,&rdquo; vociferated the
leader of this faction, a keen-faced, tow-headed man of middle
age. &ldquo;These foreigners will ruin the craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; protested Martin Byram, &ldquo;I have heard Master
Cole of Reading say that thy grandfather, his &rsquo;prentice boy,
was a Swabian, Simon. And he brought no craft to England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a laugh, for everybody knew that the superior
skill of the Flemings was one main cause of their success in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
market. Some of the weavers even had the insight to see that
so far from taking work away from any English weaver, they
were thus far doing work which would have gone abroad to
find them if they had not been here, and the gold paid them
was kept and spent in London markets.</p>

<p>For all that, the feeling against the Flemings grew and
spread, and might have broken out into open violence if they
had not been working on the King&rsquo;s tapestries. Nobody felt
like interfering with them until that job was done, for the
King might ask questions, and not like the answers.</p>

<p>How much of all this Cornelys Bat knew, no one could tell.
Cimarron watched him, but the broad, thoughtful face was
placid as usual. One day, however, the dark young apprentice
was set upon in the street, where he had gone on an errand, by
a crowd of other lads who nearly tore the clothes off his back.
They had not reckoned on effectual fighting strength in this
foreign youth, and they found that even a black sheep can be
dangerous on occasion. The threats which they muttered set
the boy&rsquo;s mountain-bred senses on the alert, and he went back
to the master weaver with the information that as soon as
the King&rsquo;s tapestries were finished the looms and their shelter
would be burned over their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hid in the loft and heard,&rdquo; said Cimarron earnestly.
&ldquo;They are evil men here, master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fleming frowned slightly and balanced the beam of
his loom&mdash;he was about to begin the last panel&mdash;thoughtfully
in his hand. &ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, we will finish the
tapestries as early as may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the weavers saw lights in the Flemish loom-rooms
that night, and reported that the strangers were working by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
candle-light, contrary to the law of the Guild&mdash;to which they
did not belong. But Cornelys Bat was gathering together the
work already done, and he and Cimarron and two of the other
men carried it before morning to the warehouse of Gilbert Gay,
the merchant, where it would be safe. They also took there
certain bales of fine wool, dyes, and some household goods,
and all this was loaded the next day on a boat and sent up
the Thames to a point above London, where Robert Edrupt&rsquo;s
pack-horses took it to King&rsquo;s Barton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no use to try to fight the entire Guild,&rdquo; said Edrupt
ruefully. &ldquo;You had best come to our village and make your
home there. When this has blown over you may come back
to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were alone I would not budge,&rdquo; said the Fleming with
a sternness in his blue eyes. &ldquo;But there are the old folk and
the little ones. We have left our own land and come where
the wool was; it is now time for the work to come to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will warrant you it will,&rdquo; said Master Gay. &ldquo;But are
you going to leave your looms for them to burn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said Cornelys Bat, grimly.</p>

<p>The mob came just after nightfall of the day after the
women and children, with the rest of the household goods, had
gone on their way to a new home. It was not a very well organized
crowd, and was armed with clubs, pikes, and torches
mainly. It found to its astonishment that the timbers of a
loom, heavy and well seasoned, may make excellent weapons,
and that the arm of a weaver is not feeble nor his spirit weak.
It was no part of the plan of Cornelys Bat to leave the buildings
of Master Gay undefended, and the determined, organized
resistance of the Flemings repelled the attack. The next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
it was found that the weavers had gone, and their quarters
were occupied by some of Master Gay&rsquo;s men who were storing
there a quantity of this year&rsquo;s fleeces. Meanwhile the Flemings
had settled in the little road that ran past the nunnery at
King&rsquo;s Barton and was called Minchen Lane.</p>

<h2>XVII<br />
<br />
THE HERBALIST&rsquo;S BREW<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW TOMASO, THE PHYSICIAN OF PADUA, FOUND A CURE FOR
A WEARY SOUL</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was thunder in the air, one summer day in
King&rsquo;s Barton. Dame Lavender, putting her drying
herbs under cover, wondered anxiously what Mary
was doing. The moods of the royal lady in the castle
depended very much on the weather, and both of late had
been uncertain. Strong-willed, hot-tempered, ambitious and
adventurous, this Queen had no traits that were suited to a
quiet existence in the country. Yet she would have been about
as safe a person to have at large as a wild-cat among harriers.
Whoever had the worst of it, the fight would be sensational.</p>

<p>When made prisoner she was on the way to the court of
France, in which her rebellious sons could always find aid.
Aquitaine was all but in open revolt against the Norman
interloper&mdash;it was only through her that Henry had held that
province at all. Scotland was ready for trouble at any time;
Ireland was in tumult; the Welsh were in a permanent state
of revolt. But Norman though he was, the King had won his
way among his English subjects. They never forgot that he
was only half Norman after all. His Saxon blood, cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
stubborn, steadied his Norman daring, and he could be alternately
bold and crafty.</p>

<p>Eleanor of Aquitaine was more an exile in her husband&rsquo;s
own country than she would have been in France or Italy.
His people might rebel against their King themselves, but they
did not sympathize with her for doing it. They were as unfeeling
as their gray, calm skies.</p>

<p>Instead of weeping and bemoaning herself she made life
difficult for her household. Oddly enough the two English
girls got on with her better than the rest. Mary&rsquo;s even, sunny
temper was never ruffled, and Barbara&rsquo;s North-country disposition
had an iron common-sense at the core. The gentle-born
damsels of the court were too yielding.</p>

<p>When little hot flashes lightened among the far-off hills,
and a distant rumble sounded occasionally, the Queen was
pacing to and fro on the top of the great keep. It was not the
safest place to be in case of a storm, for the castle was the
highest building in the neighborhood. Philippa, working
sedately at a tapestry emblem of a tower in flames, looked up
the stairway and shivered as if she were cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she queried, as the still-room maid came through
the bower, &ldquo;where is Master Tomaso?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his study, I think,&rdquo; Mary answered. &ldquo;Shall I call
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Philippa left the sentence unfinished
and folded her work; then she climbed the narrow stair.
When the Queen turned and saw her she was standing with her
slim hands resting on the battlement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing away from your tapestry-frame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
wench?&rdquo; demanded her mistress. &ldquo;Are you spying on me
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; Philippa answered gently, &ldquo;I could never
spy on you&mdash;not even if my own father wished it. I&mdash;I was
talking with Master Tomaso last night, and he said strange
things about the stars. I would you could have heard him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen laughed scornfully. &ldquo;As if it were not enough
to be prisoned in four walls, the girl wants to believe herself
the puppet of the heavens! Look you, silly pigeon, if there
be a Plantagenet star you may well fear it, for brother hates
brother and all hate their father&mdash;and belike will hate their
children. Were you asking him the day of my death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was but asking what flowers belonged to the figures of
the zodiac in my tapestry,&rdquo; answered Philippa. &ldquo;He says that
a man may rule the stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that a woman could,&rdquo; mocked the Queen. &ldquo;How
you silly creatures can go on, sticking the needle in and out, in
and out, day after day, I cannot see. One would think that
you were weavers of Fate. I had rather cast myself over the
battlements than look forward to thirty years of stitchery!&rdquo;
She swept her trailing robes about her and vanished down the
stairs. Philippa, following, saw with a certain relief that she
turned toward the rooms occupied by old Tomaso. The physician
was equal to most situations. Yet in the Queen&rsquo;s present
mood anything might arouse her anger.</p>

<p>The study was of a quaint, bare simplicity in furnishing.
It had a chair, a stool, a bench under the window, a table piled
with leather-bound books, a large chest and a small one, an
old worm-eaten oaken dresser with some flasks and dishes. A
door led into the laboratory, and another into the cell where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the philosopher slept. As the Queen entered he rose and with
grave courtesy offered her his chair, which she did not take.
She stood looking out across the quiet hills, and pressed one
hand and then the other against her cheeks&mdash;then she turned,
a dark figure against the stormy sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say that you know all medicine,&rdquo; she flung out at
him. &ldquo;Have you any physic for a wasted soul?&rdquo; With a
fierce gesture she pointed at the half-open door. &ldquo;Why do you
stay in this dull sodden England&mdash;you who are free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are times, your Grace,&rdquo; the physician replied tranquilly,
&ldquo;when I forget whether this is England or Venetia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen moved restlessly about the room, and stopped
to look at an herbal. &ldquo;Will you teach me the properties of
plants?&rdquo; she asked, as she turned the pages carelessly. &ldquo;With
Mary&rsquo;s help we might make here an herb-garden. It is well
to know the noxious plants from the wholesome, lest&mdash;unintentionally&mdash;one
should put the wrong flavor in a draught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tomaso had seen persons in this frame of mind before. He
had taught many pupils the properties of plants, but he had
his own ways of doing it. In his native city of Padua and
elsewhere, there were chemists who owed their fame to the
number of poisons they understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some experiments in hand which may interest your
Grace,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If you will come into my poor studio
you shall see them.&rdquo; He led the way into the inner chamber
where no one was ever allowed to come. The walls were lined
with shelves on which stood jars, flasks, mortars and other
utensils whose use the Queen could not guess. Tomaso did not
warn her not to touch any flask. She handled, sniffed and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
but tasted. She finally went so far as to pour a small quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of an unsensational-looking fluid into a glass, and a drop fell
on the edge of her mantle, in which it burned a clean hole.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill16" id="ill16"></a>
<a href="images/ill16h.png"><img src="images/ill16.png" width="400" height="555" alt="&ldquo;TOMASO SEEMED NOT TO HAVE SEEN HER ACTION&rdquo;" title="Click for larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;TOMASO SEEMED NOT TO HAVE SEEN HER ACTION&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Tomaso was pouring something into a bowl from a retort,
and seemed not to have seen the action. Then he added a
pinch of a colorless powder, and dipped a skein of silk into the
bowl. It came out ruby-red. Another pinch of powder, another
bath, and it was like a handful of iris petals. Other experiments
gave emerald like rain-wet leaves in sunlight, gold
like the pale outer petals of asphodels, ripe glowing orange,
blue like the Mediterranean. Then suddenly the light in the
stone-arched window was darkened and thunder crashed overhead.
The little brazier in the far corner glowed like a red
eye, and Tomaso had to light a horn lantern before the Queen
could see her way out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have to wait, now, until after the storm,&rdquo; he said,
as he led the way into the outer room. &ldquo;I am making these
experiments for the benefit of a company of weavers whom a
young friend of mine has brought here. The young man&mdash;he
is a wool-merchant&mdash;has an idea that we can weave tapestry
here as well as they can in Damascus if we have the wherewithal,
and I said that I would attend to the dyeing of the
yarn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen gave a contemptuous little laugh and sank into
the great chair. &ldquo;These Saxons! I think they are born with
paws instead of hands! They are good for nothing but to
herd cattle and plow and reap. Do your stars tell you foolish
tales like that, Master Tomaso?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not ask them,&rdquo; said the old man tranquilly. &ldquo;I use
my eyes when I can. The weavers are Flemish, and I see no
cause why they should not weave as good cloth here as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
did at home. They had English wool there, and they will
have it here. There is a Spaniard among them, and I do not
know what he will do when the chilly rains come, poor imp.
He does not like anything in England, as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor imp!&rdquo; the Queen repeated. &ldquo;How do these weavers
come here, so far from any town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they came like most folk, because they had to come,&rdquo;
smiled the Paduan. &ldquo;The English weavers are inclined to be
jealous folk, and they took the view that these Flemings were
foreigners and had no right within London Wall&mdash;or outside
it either, for they were in a lane somewhere about Mile End.
Jealousy fed also on their success in their work&mdash;it was far
superior to anything London looms can do. And certain dealers
in fine cloth saw their profits threatened, and so did the
Florentine importers. What with one thing and another Cornelys
Bat and his people had to leave the city, or lose all that
they possessed. The reasons were as mixed as the threads of
a tapestry, but that is the way with life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why are you wasting time on them?&rdquo; the Queen demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My motives are also mixed,&rdquo; answered the old man. &ldquo;Being
myself an alien in a strange land, I had sympathy for them&mdash;especially
Cimarron, the imp. Also it is interesting to work
in a new field, and I have never done much with dyestuffs. I
sometimes feel like a child gathering bright pebbles on the
shore; each one seems brighter than the last. But really, I
think I work because I dislike to spend my time in things
which will not live after me. It seemed to me that if these
Flemish weavers come here in colonies, teaching their art to
such English as can learn, it will bring this land independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and wealth in years to come. There is plenty of pasturage for
sheep, and wool needs much labor to make it fit for human use.
Edrupt, the merchant&mdash;his wife is one of your women, by the
way&mdash;says that this one craft of weaving will make cities
stronger than anything else. And that will disturb some
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen&rsquo;s eyes flashed with wicked amusement. She had
heard the King rail to his barons upon the impudence of London.
She knew that those who invaded London privilege
came poorly out of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbara&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I did not
know that he was a merchant&mdash;I thought he was one of these
clod-hopping farmers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tomaso did not enlighten her. Curiosity is the mother of
knowledge. He peered out at his fast-filling cisterns. &ldquo;This
rain-water,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;will be excellent for my dyestuffs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen gave a little light laugh. &ldquo;The heavens roar
anathema maranatha,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and the philosopher says,
&lsquo;I will fill my tubs.&rsquo; You seem to be assured that the powers
above are devoted to your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as well,&rdquo; smiled the physician, &ldquo;to have them to your
aid if possible. Some men have a&mdash;positive genius&mdash;for being
on the wrong side. The growth of a people is like the growth
of a vine. It will not twine contrary to nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these are not your people,&rdquo; the Queen persisted. &ldquo;No
one will know who did the work you are doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cornelys Bat the tapissier told me,&rdquo; Tomaso answered,
&ldquo;that no one knows now who it was who set the foot at work
by tipping the loom over, and separated the warp threads by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
two treadles. Yet that changed the whole rule of weaving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a mind to see this tapestry,&rdquo; announced Eleanor
abruptly. &ldquo;Tell your Cat, or Rat, or Bat, whatever his name
is, to bring his looms here. If he works well we will have
something for our walls besides this everlasting embroidery.
I have watched Philippa working the histories of the saints this
six months,&mdash;I believe she has all the eleven thousand virgins
of Saint Ursula to march along the wall. I am ready to burn
a candle to Saint Attila.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tomaso&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. That friendly twinkle went far
to unlock the Queen&rsquo;s confidence. &ldquo;Here am I,&rdquo; she went on
impetuously, &ldquo;mewed up here like a clipped goose that hears
the cry of the flock. If there is another Crusade I would joyfully
set forth as a man-at-arms, but belike I shall never even
hear of it. I warrant you Richard will lead a host to Jerusalem
some day&mdash;and I shall not be there to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Paduan lifted one long finger. &ldquo;You fret because you
are strong and see far. Your descendants may rule Europe.
The Plantagenets are a building race. You can lay foundations
for kings of the years to come. You have here the chance
of knowing this people, whom none of your race did ever
know truly. Your tiring women, the men who till these fields
and live by their toil, the churchmen, the traders&mdash;knowing
them you know the kingdom. Bend your wit and will to rule
the stars, madam. Thus you bring wisdom out of ill-hap, and
in that way only can a King be secure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen sat silent, chin in hand, her eyes searching the
shadows of the room, for the storm had passed and twilight
was falling. &ldquo;Gramercy for your sermon, Master Tomaso,&rdquo;
she said at last, as she rose to leave the room. &ldquo;Some day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Henry will see that it was not I who taught the Plantagenets
to quarrel. Send for your tapissiers to-morrow, and I will
study weaving for a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the comfort of all, the Queen was in a gay humor that
evening. The carved ivory chessmen were brought out, and
as she watched Ranulph and Philippa in the mimic war-game
Eleanor pondered over the recent betrothal of Princess Joan
to the King of Sicily. &ldquo;Women,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;are only
pawns on a man&rsquo;s chessboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; laughed Ranulph, as his white knight retreated, &ldquo;but
your Grace may remember that the pawn when it comes to
Queen may win the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bulky loom of Cornelys Bat was set up next morning
in the old hall, and the Queen came down to watch the strange,
complex, curious task. Then she would take the shuttle herself
and try it, and to the surprise of every one, kept at the
task until she might well have challenged a journeyman.
While the threads interlaced and shifted in a rainbow maze
her mind was traveling strange pathways. The shuttle, flung
to and fro in deft strong skill, was not like the needle with its
maddening stitch after stitch, and there was no petty chatter
in the room. The Flemish weaver might be silent, but he was
not stupid, and the drawboy, the dusky youth with the coarse
black hair, was like a wild panther-cub. Such a blend as these
weaving-folk, brought together by one aim, could teach the
arbitrary barons their place. Normandy, Aquitaine, Anjou,
Brittany,&mdash;England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales&mdash;what a web
of Empire they would make! And if into the dull russet and
gray of this England there came a vivid young life like her
Richard&rsquo;s&mdash;yellow hair, sea-blue eyes, gay daring, impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
gallantry&mdash;and under all the stern fiber of the Norman&mdash;what
kind of a tapestry would that be? Thus, as women have done
through the centuries, Eleanor of Aquitaine let her mind play
about her fingers.</p>

<p>After a while she left the work to the weavers and watched
Mary Lavender making dyestuffs under Tomaso&rsquo;s direction.
It was fascinating to try for a color and make it come to a
shade. It was yet more so to make new combinations and see
what happened. Red and green dulled each other. A touch
of orange made scarlet more brilliant. Lavender might be
deepened to royal violet or paled to the purple-gray of ashes.
The yarns, as the skillful Flemings handled them, were better
than any gold thread, and the gorgeous blossom-hues of the
wools were like an Eastern carpet.</p>

<p>Presently the Queen began devising a set of hangings for a
State bedchamber, the pictures to be scenes from the life of
Charlemagne&mdash;the suggested comparison of this monarch with
the King had its point. An Irish monk-bred lad with a knack
at catching likenesses came by, and made the designs, under
Queen Eleanor&rsquo;s direction; and during this undertaking she
learned much concerning the state of Ireland. That ended
and the weaving begun, she took to questioning Cimarron the
drawboy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she jibed, &ldquo;men grow like that they live by, or
you would never have been driven out of London like sheep.
I may become lamblike myself some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cimarron&rsquo;s white teeth gleamed. &ldquo;I would not say that we
went like sheep,&rdquo; he retorted, and he told the story of their
going. &ldquo;There were the old folk and the little ones, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Grace,&rdquo; he ended. &ldquo;The master cares for his own people,
and his work. He does not heed other folk&rsquo;s opinions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen laughed gleefully. &ldquo;I wish I had been at that
hunting&mdash;the wolves driven by their quarry. My faith, a
weaver&rsquo;s beam is not such a bad weapon after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than ten years after, when Richard&nbsp;I. was crowned
King of England, one of his first acts was to make his mother
regent in his absence. It was she who raised the money to
outbid Philip of France when C&oelig;ur de Lion was to be ransomed.
As one historian has said, she displayed qualities then
and later, which prove that she spent her days in something
besides needlework. She did not stay long at King&rsquo;s Barton,
but one of Cornelys Bat&rsquo;s tapestries was always known as the
Queen&rsquo;s Maze. In one way and another during the sixteen
years of her captivity she learned nearly all that there was to
know of the temper of the people and the nature of the land.</p>

<h2>XVIII<br />
<br />
THE HURER&rsquo;S LODGERS<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW THE POPPET OF JOAN, THE DAUGHTER OF THE CAPMAKER,
WENT TO COURT AND KEPT A SECRET</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Joan</span>, the little daughter of the hurer, sat on a three-legged
stool in the corner of her father&rsquo;s shop, nursing
her baby. It was not much of a baby, being only a piece
of wood with a knob on the end. But the shop was not
much of a shop. Gilles the hurer was a cripple, and it was all
that he could do to give Joan and her mother a roof over their
heads. They had sometimes two meals a day; oftener one;
occasionally none at all.</p>

<p>If he could have made hats and caps like those which he
used to make when he was a tradesman in Milan, every sort of
fine goods would have come into the shop. In processions and
pageants, at banquets, weddings, betrothals, christenings,
funerals, on every occasion in life, the people wore headgear
which helped to make the picture. The fashion of a man&rsquo;s hat
suited his position in life. Details and decorations varied
more or less, but the styles very seldom did. Velvet and fur
were allowed only to persons of a certain dignity; hats were
made to show embroidery, which might be of gold thread and
jeweled. Merchants wore a sort of hood with a long loose
crown which could be used as a pocket. This protected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
neck and ears on a journey, and had a lining of wool, fur, or
lambskin. Court ladies wore hoods of velvet, silk or fine cloth
for traveling. At any formal social affair a lady wore some
ornamental head-dress with a veil which she could draw over
her face. The wimple, usually worn by elderly women, was a
scarf of fine linen thrown over the head, brought closely around
the throat and chin, and held by a fillet. In later and more
luxurious and splendid times, the cone-shaped and crescent-shaped
head-dresses came in.</p>

<p>Hats were not common in the twelfth century. The hair
fell in carefully arranged curls, long braids or loose tresses on
the shoulders; the face was framed in delicate veils of silk or
sendal, kept in place by a chaplet of flowers or a coronet of
gold. Every maiden learned to weave garlands in set patterns,
and could make a wreath in any one of several given styles, for
her own hair or for decorating a building. Red, green and
blue were the colors most often used in dress, and on any festival
day the company presented a very gay appearance.</p>

<p>Gilles, however, was obliged to confine himself to the making
of hures or rough woolen caps for common men. He had
no apprentices, although his wife and daughter sometimes
helped him. His shop was a corner of a very old building
most of which had been burned in a great London fire. It was
the oldest house in the street and was roofed with stone, which
probably saved it. The ends of the beams in the wall fitted
into sockets in other beams, and were set straight, crooked or
diagonally without any apparent plan. Two or three hundred
years before, when the house was built, the space between the
timbers had been filled in with interlaced branches, over which
mud was plastered on in thick coats. This made the kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
wall known as &ldquo;wattle and daub.&rdquo; It was not very scientific
in appearance, but it was weather-proof. As there was no
fireplace or hearth, the family kept warm&mdash;when it could&mdash;by
means of an iron brazier filled with coals. Cooking&mdash;when
they had anything to cook&mdash;was done over the brazier in a
chafing-dish, or in a tiny stone fireplace outside the rear wall,
made of scattered stones by Joan&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>Gilles was a Norman, but he had been born in Sicily, which
had been conquered by the Norman adventurer Guiscard long
before. He had gone to Milan when a youth, and there he
had met Joan&rsquo;s mother&mdash;and stayed. The luxury of Lombard
cities made any man who could manufacture handsome clothing
sure of a living. &ldquo;Milaner and Mantua-Maker&rdquo; on a sign
above a shop centuries later meant a shop where one could find
the latest fashions. Gilles was prosperous and happy, and his
little girl was just learning to walk, when the siege of Milan
put an end to everything. He came to London crippled from
a wound and palsied from fever and set about finding work.</p>

<p>They might have starved if it had not been for a Florentine
artist, Matteo, who was also a stranger in London, but had
all that he could do. He lodged for a year in the solar chamber,
as the room above the shop was called. Poor as their
shelter was, it had this room to spare. Matteo paid his way in
more than money; he improved the house. He understood
plaster work, and covered the inner walls with a smooth
creamy mixture which made a beautiful surface for pictures.
On this fair and spotless plaster he made studies of what he
saw day by day, drawing, painting, painting out and making
new studies as he certainly could not have done had he been
lodged in a palace. All along two sides of the shop was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
procession of dignitaries in the most gorgeous of holiday robes.
In the chamber above were portraits of the King and Queen,
the Bishop of London, Prior Hagno preaching to a crowd at
Bartlemy Fair, some of the chief men of the government, and
animals wild and tame. He told Joan stories about the paintings,
and these walls were the only picture-books that she had.</p>

<p>Then they sheltered a smooth-spoken Italian called
Giuseppe, who nearly got them into terrible trouble. He not
only never paid a penny, but barely escaped the officers of the
law, who asked a great many questions about him and how
they came to harbor him. After that they made it a rule not
to take any one in unless he was recommended by some one
they knew. It was worse to go to prison than to be hungry.</p>

<p>One day, when Gilles had just been paid for some work
done for Master Nicholas Gay, the rich merchant, a slender,
dark-eyed youth with a workman&rsquo;s pack on his shoulder came
and asked for a room. Hardly had Joan called her mother
when the stranger reeled and fell unconscious on the floor of
the shop. He did not know where he was or who he was for
days. They remembered Giuseppe and were dubious, but they
kept him and tended him until he was able to talk. His tools
and his hands showed him to be a wood-carver, and his dress
was foreign. His illness was something like what used to be
called ship-fever, due to the hard conditions of long voyages,
in wooden ships not too clean.</p>

<p>When their guest was able to talk he told them that he was
Quentin, a wood-carver of Peronne. He had met Matteo in
Messina and thus heard of this lodging. He had come to
London to work at the oaken stalls of the Bishop of Ely&rsquo;s
private chapel in Holborn. These stalls, or choir-seats, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Gothic church were designed to suit the stately high-arched
building. Their straight tall backs were carved in wood, and
the arm-rests ended in an ornament called a finial. Often no
two stalls were alike, and yet the different designs were shaped
to fit the general style, so that the effect was uniform. The
carving of one pair of arms might be couchant lions; on the
next, leopards; on the next, hounds, and so on. The seats
were usually hinged and could be raised when not in use.
The under side of the seat, which then formed part of all this
elaborate show of decoration, was most often carved with
grotesque little squat figures of any sort that occurred to the
artist. Here Noah stuck his head out of a nutshell Ark; there
a woman belabored her husband for breaking a jug; on the
next stall might be three solemn monkeys making butter in a
churn. Quentin&rsquo;s fancy was apt to run to little wood-goblins,
mermaids, crowned lizards, fauns, and flying ships. He came
from a country where the forests are full of fairy-tales.</p>

<p>Joan would be very sorry to have Quentin go away. She
was thinking of this as she sat in the twilight nursing her
wooden poppet. When he came in at last he had his tools
with him, and a piece of fine hard wood about two feet long.
Seating himself on a bench he lit the betty lamp on the wall,
and laying out his knives and gouges he began to carve a face
on the wood.</p>

<p>Joan could not imagine what he was making, and she
watched intently. The face grew into that of a charming
little lady, with eyes crinkled as if they laughed, and a dimple
in her firm chin. The hair waved over the round head; the
neck was as softly curved as a pigeon&rsquo;s. The gown met in a
V&nbsp;shape at the throat, with a bead necklace carved above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
There was a close-fitting bodice, with sleeves that came down
over the wrists and wrinkled into folds, and a loose over-sleeve
that came to the elbow. The skirt fell in straight folds
and there was a little ornamental border in a daisy pattern
around the hem. When the statuette was finished and set up,
it was like a court lady made small by enchantment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a poppet for thee, small one,&rdquo; Quentin said
smiling.</p>

<p>Joan&rsquo;s hands clasped tight and her eyes grew big and dark.
&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a poor return for the kindness that I have had in this
house,&rdquo; answered Quentin brushing the chips into the brazier.</p>

<p>The poppet seemed to bring luck to the hurer&rsquo;s household.
Through Gilles, Master Gay had heard of Quentin&rsquo;s work,
and he ordered a coffret for his wife, and a settle. The arms
of the settle were to be carved with little lady-figures like
Joan&rsquo;s, and Master Gay asked if they could not all be portraits
of Princesses. Joan&rsquo;s own poppet was named Marguerite for
the daughter of the French King, who had married the eldest
son of Henry&nbsp;II. Quentin had copied the face from Matteo&rsquo;s
sketch upon the wall, and in one room or the other were all the
other members of the royal family. But as it would not be
suitable to show Queens and Princesses upholding the arms
of a chair in the house of a London merchant, Quentin suggested
that they change the design, and use the leopards of
Anjou for the arms, while the statuettes of the Princesses were
ranged along the top of the high back. There could be five
open-work arches with a figure in each, and plain linen-fold
paneling below. Where the carving needed a flower or so
he would put alternately the lilies of France and the sprig of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
broom which was the badge of the Plantagenets. Thus the
piece of carving would commemorate the fact that the family
of the King of England was related to nearly every royal house
in Europe through marriage. It would be a picture-chronicle.</p>

<p>In the middle arch was Marguerite, who would be Queen
of England some day if her husband lived. At her right hand
was Constance of Brittany, wife of Geoffrey, who through her
would inherit that province. The other figures were Eleanor,
who was married to Alfonso, King of Castile; Matilda, who
was the wife of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, the most
powerful vassal of the German Emperor; and Joan, the youngest,
betrothed to William, called the Good, King of Sicily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be two more princesses some day,&rdquo; said Joan,
cuddling Marguerite in her arms as she watched Quentin&rsquo;s deft
strokes. &ldquo;Prince Richard is not married yet, and neither is
Prince John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The work cannot wait for that, little one,&rdquo; Quentin answered
laughing. &ldquo;Richard is only sixteen, and John still
younger. Yet they do say that the King is planning an alliance
with Princess Alois of France for Richard, and is in
treaty with Hubert the Duke of Maurienne for his daughter to
wed with John. I think, myself, that Richard will choose
his own bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan said nothing, but in her own mind she thought it
would be most unpleasant to be married off like that, by arrangements
made years before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marriage with Hubert&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; Quentin added
half to himself, &ldquo;would keep open the way into Italy if it
were needed. It is a bad thing to have an enemy blocking
your gate.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Although her poppet was carved so that the small out-held
hands and arms were clear of the body, and dresses could be
fitted over them, Joan found that there were but few points
or edges that were likely to be chipped off. The wood was well
seasoned, and the carving followed the grain most cunningly.
Neither dampness nor wood-boring insects could easily get into
the channels where sap once ran. This was part of the wisdom
of wood-carving.</p>

<p>When Joan grew too old to play with her poppet she sometimes
carried her to some fine house to show a new fashion,
or style of embroidery. Marguerite had a finer wardrobe than
any modern doll, for the little hats, hoods and head-dresses
had each a costume to go with it, and all were kept in a chest
Quentin had made for her, with the arms of Milan on the lid.
No exiled Milanese ever quite gave up the hope that some day
the city would be rebuilt in all its splendor, and the foreign
governors driven from Lombardy. Joan used to hear her
father talking of it with their next lodger, Giovanni Bergamotto,
who was a peddler at fairs. Gilles had had steady work
for a long time, and was making not only the rough caps he
used to make, now turned out by an apprentice, but fine hats
and caps for the wealthy. A carved and gilded hat swung
before the door, and Joan learned embroidery of every kind.
She saw Quentin now and then, and one day he sent word to
her, by the wool-merchant Robert Edrupt, that Queen Eleanor
wished to see the newest court fashions, and that Joan might
journey with Edrupt and his wife to the abbey where she was
living. It was one of the best known houses in England, and
the Abbess was of royal blood. It was not at all unusual for
its guest-rooms to be occupied by Queens and Princesses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Quentin had been sent there to do some work for the Abbey,
and in that way the Queen, through Philippa, her maid of
honor, had heard of Joan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is a natural desire in a woman,&rdquo; Master Edrupt
said when they talked of the matter, &ldquo;but somehow I would
stake my head it is not the fashions she is after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara his wife smiled but said nothing. She agreed.</p>

<p>When Joan had modestly shown her wares, and the little
wooden court lady had smiled demurely through it all, the
Queen dandled Marguerite on her knee and thoughtfully
looked her over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The face is surely like the Princess of France,&rdquo; she said.
And Joan felt more than ever certain that there was a reason
for this interest in poppets.</p>

<p>Later in the day she found out what it was. Quentin was
carving other little lady-figures like those he had made years
ago for Master Gay. He had also made the figures of a
Bishop, a King, a Monk, and a Merchant; with a grotesque
hump-backed hook-nosed Dwarf for the Jester. It looked
as if a giant were about to play chess. Padraig, an Irish
scribe who had made some designs for the Queen&rsquo;s tapestry-workers,
was using his best penmanship to copy certain letters
on fine parchment. Giovanni, who had sprung up from somewhere,
was making a harness-like contrivance of hempen cords,
iron hooks and rods, and wooden pulleys. When finished it
went into a small bag of tow-cloth; if stretched out it filled
the end of a rough wooden frame. Joan began to suspect that
the figures were for a puppet-show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to explain,&rdquo; Quentin said to the others. &ldquo;We
can trust Joan. She is as true as steel.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Joan&rsquo;s heart leaped with pride. If Milan had only honor
left, her children would keep that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this, Joan,&rdquo; Quentin went on kindly. &ldquo;In time of
war any messenger may be searched, and we do not know when
war will come. King Henry desires above all things the peace
of his realm. He will not openly take the side of the Lombard
cities against Frederick Barbarossa&mdash;yet. But he will throw
all his influence into the scale if he can. The Queen has hit
upon a way by which letters can be sent safely to the courts
of Brittany, France, Castile, Sicily, and even to Saxony, which
is in Barbarossa&rsquo;s own domains. Giovanni will travel as a
peddler, with the weaver-boy Cimarron as his servant or companion,
as may seem best. He will have a pack full of such
pretty toys as maidens love,&mdash;broidered veils, pomanders, perfumed
gloves, girdles&mdash;nothing costly enough to tempt robbers&mdash;and
these wooden poppets of ours. We cannot trust the
tiring-women in times like these, but he may be able to give
the letters into the hands of the Queens themselves. No one,
surely, will suspect a poppet. These gowns and wimples will
display the fashions, and I had another reason for telling you
to bring them all. If he cannot get his chance as a peddler he
can hang about the court with a puppet-show. Now, look
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quentin took the softly smiling poppet and began to twist
her neck. When he had unscrewed the dainty little head a
deep hole appeared in the middle of the figure. Into this
Padraig fitted a roll of parchment, and over it a wooden peg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May she keep it?&rdquo; Quentin asked gently. &ldquo;There is need
for haste, and I have not time to make another figure.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Joan swallowed hard. Marguerite had heard many secrets
that no one else knew. &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will let her go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then each little figure in turn received its secret to keep,
and Joan, Lady Philippa, and the other maids sewed furiously
for a day and a half. Each Princess was gowned in robes
woven with the arms of her kingdom. The other figures were
suitably dressed. The weights which made the jester turn a
somersault were gold inside a lead casing&mdash;Giovanni might
need that. There were jewels hidden safely in his dagger-hilt
and Cimarron&rsquo;s, but to all appearance they were two common
chapmen. They were gone for a long time, but Marguerite&mdash;

<h2>XIX<br />
<br />
DICKON AT THE FORGE<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW A SUSSEX SMITH FOUND THE WORLD COME TO HIM IN
THE WEALD</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> smithy was very small compared with a modern
foundry. It was not large even for a country blacksmith&rsquo;s
shop; the cottage close by was hardly bigger;
yet that forge made iron-work which went all over
England. It was on one of the Sussex roads leading into
Lewes. Often a knight would stop to have something done
to his own armor or his horse&rsquo;s gear, for the war-horse also
wore armor,&mdash;on head and breast at least. Some of the work
of old Adam Smith had gone as far as Jerusalem. Dickon felt
occasionally that if he were a spear-head or a dagger, he would
stand more chance of seeing the world than he did as the son
of his father.</p>

<p>Adam was secretly proud of the lad who at thirteen could
do nearly as much as he himself could. That was saying more
than a little, for Adam Smith had the knack of making every
blow count by putting it in exactly the right place. A man
who can do that will double his strength.</p>

<p>Dickon had inherited the knack, but he had something else
besides, of which his father knew nothing. He never did a
piece of work that he did not try to make it look right. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
could see that when the bar that latched a gate was of a certain
length, not too small or too large, it pleased both eye and
hand. He did not consider the hinges on the door better looking
for being made into an elaborate pattern, unless the pattern
was a good one. In short, Dickon had what is known as
a sense of beauty. Some have it and some have not. Those
who have can invent beautiful patterns, while those who have
not can only copy,&mdash;and they do not always copy accurately.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to speak of beauty in the iron-work of
a little country smithy, but nothing is more beautiful in its
way than good iron-work. There are gates, hinges, locks, keys
and other furnishings which are so well designed that one is
never weary of studying them. Armor has been made beautiful
in its time; so have swords, halberds, daggers, fire-baskets,
and fire-dogs.</p>

<p>Because iron is so simple, and there is no chance of getting
an effect by using color or gilding, the task of making it beautiful
is unlike that of painting a picture. The beauty of iron-work
is the line, the curve, the proportion. If these are wrong
one sees it at once; and the same is true when the work is
right. Most of the work of Adam Smith, while strong and
well wrought, was only by accident good to look at. Dickon
was not allowed to do anything that his father did not oversee,
and Adam Smith saw to it that no job left his shop which was
not well done. Dickon had found out, little by little, that
when a thing is strong enough for its use, with no unnecessary
clumsiness, and the handles, catches and rivetings are where
they ought to be for strength and convenience, it usually looks
very well. That is to say, beautiful iron-work is useful and
economical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Dickon was hammering away, one golden autumn morning,
on the latch for a gate. The cattle had broken into the Fore
Acre again, and Adam, who had to go to Lewes on business,
told Dickon to make that latch and do it properly, so that it
would keep the gate shut. Old Wat had gone into the forest
for some wood, for the great belt of woodland called the
Weald was all around, and the oak from it served for fuel.
Dickon had never seen a coal fire in his life. Forges like this
were scattered all through the Weald, and what with the iron-workers
and the ship-builders, and the people who wainscoted
their houses with good Sussex oak, there is no Weald left nowadays.
That part of the country keeps its name, and there
are groves of oak here and there, but that is all.</p>

<p>Dickon could see from the door the acorns dropping from
the great oak that sheltered the smithy and was so huge that
a man could not circle it with his arms. He began to wonder
if he could put some sort of ornamental work on that latch.</p>

<p>No one could have looked less like an artist than the big,
muscular youth in his leathern apron, with his rough tow-head
and square-chinned face; but inside his brain was a thought
working itself out. He took an oak twig and laid it in this
position and that, on the iron.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to work out a design in iron. The iron
must be heated, and beaten or bent into shape while it is soft.
There is no making a sketch and taking your time with the
brushes. Dickon thought he would see if he could draw a
pattern. He took a bit of coal and a wooden tile fallen from
the roof, and began to combine the lines of the gate-latch with
those of the twig. He had not copied iron utensils and other
patterns without knowing how to draw the lines of an oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
leaf, but he found that somehow or other the leaf, as an ornament
to the latch, did not look right. The cluster of acorns
was better, but even that did not fit. Dickon&rsquo;s feeling, though
he did not think it out, was that iron is strong, and an oak
tree is one of the strongest of trees, and therefore the oak was
suitable to decorate Sussex iron. He changed the lines, rubbing
out one and then another, until he had got a set of curves
and little nubbly knot-like ornaments which were not exactly
like the oak twig, but suited the lines of the latch. The leaf-like
side-pieces covered the parts of the latch where the fingers
and thumb would rest in opening the gate, and the projecting
handle might be made into something suggesting an acorn-cluster.
He nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather good,&rdquo; said a voice over his shoulder.
&ldquo;Where did you learn to draw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickon jumped; he had been so busy that he had not heard
the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs on the turf. The stranger who
stood there, bridle over arm, was a rather slender man, five or
six years older than Dickon, with deep-set hazel eyes, fair
hair, and muddy boots that looked as if he had come a long
journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody never taught me,&rdquo; said Dickon soberly. &ldquo;I was
trying to find out how to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You found out then. It is good&mdash;don&rsquo;t touch it. Is it for
that gate-latch? Go on and finish the job; I won&rsquo;t hinder
you. I&rsquo;m a Sussex man, but I never came through the Weald
this way. I lost my road, and they told me this would take
me to Lewes. The nag and I shall both be the better for an
hour&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickon blew up the fire and went to work, with strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
deft strokes. He was not a shy lad, particularly when he was
doing what he could do well. He was used to working with
people watching him. Not seldom they were making themselves
disagreeable because the work was not done more
quickly, but iron cannot be hurried. If a smith does not mean
to spoil the temper of his work, he must keep his own temper
well in hand.</p>

<p>The young man led his horse into the shade, and came to
watch Dickon. As the leaf-curves began to stand out and the
nubs of the acorn-cluster took shape he seemed more and more
interested. Once he began to ask a question, but stopped himself,
as if he knew that when a man has his whole mind on a
task he cannot spare any part of it for talk. Dickon almost
forgot that he was there. He was intent upon putting exactly
the right hollows and veins in the leaf, and giving exactly the
right twist to the handle.</p>

<p>At last it was done. Dickon straightened his back and
looked at it, as the sunlight wavered upon it through the
branches. The stranger clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better than the sketch,&rdquo; he cried heartily. &ldquo;It is good
indeed. I have been in London, lad, in the Low Countries and
in France, and I never saw a sweeter bit of work. How didst
know the true line for that handle?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill18" id="ill18"></a>
<a href="images/ill18h.png"><img src="images/ill18.png" width="400" height="534" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;IT IS BETTER THAN THE SKETCH,&rsquo; HE CRIED HEARTILY&rdquo;" title="Click for larger image" /></a>
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;IT IS BETTER THAN THE SKETCH,&rsquo; HE CRIED HEARTILY&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to make it open properly,&rdquo; Dickon explained, &ldquo;fits
the hand, like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other nodded approvingly. &ldquo;I see. I learned that
same lesson in my pottery. &lsquo;Wilfrid,&rsquo; my old master used to
tell me, &lsquo;never thee make too small an ear to thy jugs if thou
lik&rsquo;st the maids to love &rsquo;ee.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a knack, you see, in making
a handle with a good grip to it, that will neither spill the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
milk nor hinder pouring. My wife she helped me there. She
loves good work as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adam Smith, coming up the Lewes road next day, could not
think what had happened when he saw Dickon in eager talk
with a stranger. The boy had never been given to words. He
was more taken aback when Master Wilfrid told him that his
son had the making of a rare workman. He answered gruffly,
stroking his big beard:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, the lad&rsquo;s well enow. Latch done, Dickon? Go and
fit it to yon gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilfrid had come back to England full of new ideas, and
ambitious above all for the honor of English craftsmen.
When he found this youth working out, without any model at
all, a thing so good as the oak-leaved gate-latch, he was surer
than ever that the land he loved could raise her own smiths.
It was his ambition to make his own house beautiful within
and without, as were some of the merchants&rsquo; houses he had
seen in cities. He further astonished the old smith by telling
him that if Dickon would put some time on work along his
own lines, he would pay him double or treble what he would
earn at common labor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained the potter, as he showed the design
he had drafted for a carved oaken chest, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s much to be
thought of in iron-work. You have to make it strong as well
as handsome, and what&rsquo;s more, nine times out of ten you have
to fit it to the work of some other man. It&rsquo;d never do for the
hinges and handles on this coffer to spoil the looks o&rsquo; the
carving, and that&rsquo;s to be done in London, d&rsquo; ye see? Belike
I&rsquo;ll have you make those first, Dickon, and let Quentin suit
his pattern to yours. He can.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he make his design?&rdquo; queried Dickon. &ldquo;Work
it out as he goes along&mdash;like iron-work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; Wilfrid answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a many patterns
drawn out on parchment besides what he carries in his
head. But they&rsquo;re only for show&mdash;to give an idea of the
style. When he gets the size and shape and the wood he&rsquo;s to
use settled, he changes the pattern according to his own judgment.
If a wood-carver doesn&rsquo;t know his trade the design can
be made by an artist, and all he need do is to follow it. But
that&rsquo;s not my idea of good work. Unless you&rsquo;ve made such a
thing yourself you don&rsquo;t know how the lines are going to look.
I&rsquo;d never try to make a design for a fire-dog, and I doubt
you&rsquo;d make a poor job at shaping an earthen bowl. Then, if
you want to suit yourself and your customer, you&rsquo;ll be changing
your pattern with every job. The work ought to grow&mdash;like
a plant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dickon commented. &ldquo;You make an iron pot for
a woman, and another for her neighbor, and ten to one the
second must be a bit bigger or narrower or somehow different.
You&rsquo;ve got to go by your eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; Wilfrid went on musingly, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s like
to be mechanical ways to help the work&mdash;turn it out quicker&mdash;do
the planing and gouging with some kind of engine and finish
by hand. It seemed to me that would take the life out o&rsquo; the
carving. I said so to Quentin, and he laughed. He said a man
could use any tool to advantage if he had the head, but without
thought you couldn&rsquo;t make a shovel go right. I reckon
that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adam Smith nodded. &ldquo;Half the smiths don&rsquo;t know the way
to use a hammer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and well-nigh all the rest don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
know what they&rsquo;re making. You stick to the old forge a while
yet, lad. There&rsquo;s a bit to learn afore you&rsquo;ll be master o&rsquo; the
trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Master Wilfrid admitted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
not waste your time by learning all that he can teach you. As
I was saying to you yesterday, you&rsquo;ve been doing good plain
work and learned judgment. You know how to bend a rod
so that it&rsquo;ll be strong, and that will make it look strong. And
I&rsquo;ll warrant when you come to make a grille for a pair of iron
gates you&rsquo;ll know where to put your cross-bars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For all that, Master Wilfrid did not mean to lose sight of
Dickon. He knew how much a youth could learn by talking
with men of other crafts, and he intended that Dickon should
have his chance. He himself had lost no opportunity, while
on his travels, of becoming acquainted with men who were
doing good work in England, and now and then one of these
men would turn off the main road to see him at his pottery or
his home. When the time came to forge a pair of iron gates
to the parish church, he saw to it that Dickon got the refusal
of the work. With his favorite tools and his father&rsquo;s gruff
&ldquo;God speed ye, lad!&rdquo; Dickon rode forth to his first work for
himself, and it was done to the satisfaction of every one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew that Sussex brains could handle that job,&rdquo; Wilfrid
exulted, as they looked at the finished task. In days when
churches and cathedrals were open all day long, it was desirable
to have some sort of open-work railing to keep stray beasts
out of the chancel. In a more splendid building this railing
might have been of silver, but the homely farmer-folk thought
the iron of the Weald was good enough for them.</p>

<p>Up along the grassy track past the south door of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
rode a company of travelers, middle-class folk by their dress.
As they came abreast of the gate the foremost called out, &ldquo;Ho,
Wilfrid, is there any tavern hereabouts? We be lost sheep
in the wilderness. The Abbey guest-house is already full and
they will not take us in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, it&rsquo;s good to see thee here, Robert Edrupt,&rdquo; the potter
answered. &ldquo;I could house three or four of you, but it&rsquo;s
harvest time, that&rsquo;s a fact. No, there&rsquo;s no tavern in the village.
You see, most of the folk that travel this way go to the Abbey
for a lodging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stick together, I reckon,&rdquo; answered Edrupt, &ldquo;if you
can give us some kind o&rsquo; shelter, and the makings of a meal.
A barn would serve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do better than that,&rdquo; Wilfrid assured them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
ye to Cold Harbor. It&rsquo;s part of a Roman house that we uncovered
near the pottery. The walls were used in the old
farmer&rsquo;s time for a granary. It&rsquo;s weather-proof, and there&rsquo;s
a stone hearth, and Dickon here will help swing a crane for
the kettles. We&rsquo;ve plenty stores if there&rsquo;s a cook among ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can make shift,&rdquo; laughed Edrupt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to the
house to-morrow and gossip a bit. Quentin here has your
carved coffer for ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the lad that made the hinges and the handles,&rdquo;
Wilfrid added, with a hand on the big youth&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Sithee here, Dickon, you show them their way to their lodging,
and I&rsquo;ll e&rsquo;en ride home and tell Edwitha to spare some
pots and kettles for the cooking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Dickon was shoved all in a moment, in the edge of an
autumn evening, into the company of merchants and craftsmen
such as he had never met. The North-countryman, Alan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of York, was a glazier; David Saumond, a Scotch stone-mason
coming up from Canterbury to do some work for an
Abbey; Guy of Limoges was a goldsmith; Crispin Eyre, a
shoemaker of London; there were two or three merchants,
some weavers newly arrived from overseas, various servants
and horse-boys, and two peddlers of dark foreign aspect. The
talk was mostly in a mixture of French and English, but
Dickon understood this better than he could speak it, and
several of the men were as English as himself. In the merry
company at supper he saw what Wilfrid had meant when he
said that hand-skill without head-wisdom was walking blind-fold,
and work done alone was limping labor. It was the
England of the guilds breaking bread by that fire.</p>

FLORENTINE GENIUS</span></h2>

</div>
<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">Padraig</span> was having his first view of a foreign
country. England, to be sure, was
somewhat strange to a boy who had never
before been outside Ireland. Brother Basil,
who had taught him all that he knew of
writing, reading, painting and other arts, had come
to England on business for the Irish Abbeys and
was going no further. Padraig felt that he wanted
to see more of the world.</p>

<p>Perhaps the wise monk felt that unless his pupil had the
chance now to wander and come back, he would run away and
never return at all; at any rate he told the youth that this
would be a good time to make the pilgrimage to Rome if he
could. There was peace in Lombardy for the moment, and the
Pope, driven out more than once by the warring Emperor of
Germany, was now in the Vatican, again.</p>

<p>A fishing-boat, slipping over to Calais in the light of a windy
dawn, carried one passenger, a red-headed boy in a hooded
cloak of rough black frieze. Padraig&rsquo;s own feet bore him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
from town to town until now, in a French city, he stood in
the doorway of a gray and stately church alive with pictures.
On a scaffold slung up behind the altar a painter sat working
on a new altar-piece.</p>

<p>This was something which Padraig had never seen. He had
painted pictures himself on parchment, and drawn designs in
color for the craftsmen, but a wall-painting so full of life and
color that it looked like a live angel come down from the
skies, he had never seen made by any man.</p>

<p>It was in three parts, filling three arches, the middle one
larger than the others. In the center was the beautiful brooding
Mother with the Child in her arms, and her dull red mantle
seemed to lift and float like a sunset cloud. In the narrower
spaces were figures of saints. One, already finished, was an
old man in the dress of a hermit, with a hind; the graceful
creature nestled its head against him. An arrow transfixed his
knee, and Padraig knew that this was Saint Giles, patron saint
of cripples. The last of the three, on which the artist was
now working, was Saint Margaret and the dragon. The
dragon was writhing away, with a dreadful look of rage and
fear, before the cross in the hands of the brave, beautiful
young girl. The sun crept through a loophole window and
made the pictures, at the end of the long vista of gray arches,
as real as living beings.</p>

<p>Even at this distance, nevertheless, the trained eye of Padraig
detected something the matter with that dragon. The
artist painted, scraped out, scowled, pondered and finally flung
down his brushes in impatient disgust. He moved away, his
eyes still on the unfinished work, and backed directly into
Padraig.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;oh, I did not know that there was any one here.
Look at that dragon, did you ever see such a creature!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Softly, softly, Matteo,&rdquo; spoke a superior-looking man in
the dress of a sub-prior, behind them. &ldquo;What is wrong with
the picture? It looks very well, to me. We must have it finished,
you understand, before the feast of Saint Giles, in any
case. You must remember, dear son, that these works are
not for the purpose of delighting the eye. The figure of
Our Lady would be more impressive if you were to add a
gold border to the mantle, would it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padraig retreated. He was still grinning over the expression
on the artist&rsquo;s face, when he took out a bit of crayon
and at a safe distance made a sketch of the pompous church-man
on a convenient stone. Having caught the likeness he
took from his scrip a half-completed &ldquo;Book of Legends,&rdquo;
and in the wide-open mouth of a squirming dragon which
formed the initial he drew the head and shoulders of the half-swallowed
Sub-Prior.</p>

<p>Just as he sat back to survey the design, Matteo strode down
the path and stopped with his hand on the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; the artist spluttered. &ldquo;Did you hear
him? Because he is the secretary of the Archbishop and
keeps the pay-roll he thinks he can instruct me in my work!
If I had to paint the things he describes I would whitewash
every one of my pictures and spend the rest of my days in a
scullery! There, at least, no fault would be found because
the work was too well done!</p>

<p>&ldquo;That monster will be the death of me yet. I know that
Le Gargouille never looked like that. He was a great dragon,
you know, who lived in the Seine and ravaged the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
until he was destroyed by Saint Romaine. They do not infest
our rivers any more&mdash;they have taken to the church. My
faith, if I knew where to find one I would lead that stupid
monk down there by the ear and show him what a dragon is
like. I never saw a dragon&mdash;it is not my business to paint
dragons&mdash;but I know that they ought to be slippery shining
green like a frog, or a lizard&mdash;and I cannot get the color.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this anything like?&rdquo; asked Padraig, and he held up
the book.</p>

<p>Padraig&rsquo;s mind worked by leaps, Brother Basil used to say,
and it had made a jump while the artist was talking. The
most that he had thought of, when he made the sketch in his
book, was that the face of the Sub-Prior would be a good one
to use some day for a certain kind of character; and then it
had occurred to him to fancy the dragon showing his appreciation
of the dignitary in a natural way. He had already
done the dragon with the last of the green that he and Brother
Basil brought from Ireland, before he came to France, and it
was a clear transparent brilliant color that looked like a new-born
water-plant leaf in the sun. He had watched lizards and
frogs, in long dreamy afternoons by the fishing-pools, too
many times not to remember.</p>

<p>The painter&rsquo;s mobile dark face changed to half a dozen
expressions in a minute. He chuckled over the caricature;
then he looked at the work more closely; then he fluttered
over the other leaves of the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get the color for this?&rdquo; he queried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made it,&rdquo; said Padraig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you make it again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padraig hesitated. &ldquo;Is there a forest near by?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Forest&mdash;no; but why? For the hunting of dragons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no, b-but&mdash;&rdquo; Padraig was apt to stammer when excited&mdash;
&ldquo;if I had balsam like ours I could make the green.
We had none, and so we hunted until we found the right
resin&mdash;Brother Basil and I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Basil Ossorin, an Irish monk from England?&rdquo; asked Matteo
quickly. &ldquo;I met him ten years since when he was on his
way to Byzantium. If he was your master you have had good
teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padraig nodded. Brother Basil was the man whom he
best loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no trouble about the balsam if you know it when
you see it,&rdquo; the artist went on. &ldquo;I will take you to a place
where anything may be bought&mdash;cobalt, lapis lazuli, cinnabar,
orpiment, sandarac&mdash;and it is honestly sold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padraig numbered the matters off on his fingers. &ldquo;Copper,&mdash;and
Venice turpentine,&mdash;and saffron, to make him yellow
underneath like water-snakes in an old pond. His wings
must be smooth&mdash;and green&mdash;bright, and mottled with rusty
brown&mdash;the sun comes from behind, and he must look as if it
were shining through the halo round the maiden&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder now about that balsam,&rdquo; mused the painter.</p>

<p>Padraig drew an outline in the dust on the stone flags.
&ldquo;The tree is like this&mdash;the leaf and berry like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matteo laughed with pure satisfaction. &ldquo;That is all right;
the tree grows in the abbey gardens. Come, young imp with
the crest of fire, come quickly, and we will have a glorious
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not certain who painted more of that dragon, the
master or the journeyman. Padraig directed the making of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the vivid gold-green as if he were the artist and the other the
grinder of paints. Matteo dragged old Brother Joseph, the
caretaker, from his work in the crypt to scrape the original
dragon off the wall until only the outline of curling body and
webbed wings remained. The design was all right, for that
was Matteo&rsquo;s especial skill. He could make a wall-painting
as decorative and well-proportioned as the stiff symbolic figures,
and yet make the picture natural.</p>

<p>There was a fearful moment when the paint was ready
and they made the trial, for neither was sure that the pigment
would look right on this new surface. But it gleamed a living
green. Padraig brightened the scaled body with yellow where
the light struck it. Matteo used his knowledge of armor to
deepen the shadows with a cunning blend of blue and bronze
that made the scales look metallic. Each worked on a wing,
spreading it with sure swift strokes across the base of the
scene. Just as Padraig drew his brush for the last time along
the bony framework of the clutching talons, the painter caught
him by the arm and drew him back down the nave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The dragon wallowed at the feet of Saint Margaret in
furious, bewildered rage. Old Brother Joseph, coming out of
the corner where he had been sitting half asleep, looked actually
frightened at the creature. Matteo, well pleased, did
not wait for the verdict of the monks, but took Padraig home
to his lodgings in a narrow street of the town, and they sat
up late that night in talk over many things.</p>

<p>The painter was a Florentine, and when at home he lived
in a street even then called the Street of the Painters, in Florence.
He had been in London years before, in Paris, in Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
in Spain, in Sicily. Now he had commissions for the decorating
of a palace in Rouen, and he took Padraig&rsquo;s breath away
by suggesting that they work together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; Matteo averred thoughtfully, &ldquo;there will be
cathedrals in Italy, France, Normandy, Aquitaine, England,
greater than the world has seen. There will be cliffs and forests
of stone-work&mdash;arches, towers, pinnacles, groined and
vaulted roofs, hundreds of statues of the saints. Every inch
of it will be made beautiful as the forest is&mdash;with vines and
creeping mosses, blossoms and the little wood-folk that shelter
among trees. There will be great windows of stained and
painted glass. There will be altar-pieces like those that we
only dream to-day. I tell you, Patricio mio, we are in the
dawn of the millennium of the builders. What has been done
already is nothing&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padraig found in the following months that a group of
young Italians, Matteo and some of his friends, were working
along a new line, with models and methods that accounted
for the beauty of their achievements. The figures that they
painted met with scant appreciation oftentimes, for many of
the churchmen desired only symbolic figures of bright colors,
with gilding to make them rich. Moreover, there was a very
general disbelief in the permanence of wall-painting. Walls
were damp, and the only really satisfactory decoration thus
far had been the costly and tedious mosaic. Made of thousands
of tiny blocks of stone of various colors, the design of
the mosaic had to be suited to the infinite network of little
cracks and the knowledge of the worker. Kings and noblemen
usually preferred tapestry which could be saved in case
of disaster, and carried about, to costly wall-paintings which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
must remain where they were. Yet Padraig found Matteo&rsquo;s
rich and graceful figures equal in their way to the stone sculptures
of any French master, and said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is like this, comrade,&rdquo; the Florentine explained, slipping
his arm across Padraig&rsquo;s shoulders as they strolled past the
church of Saint Ouen. &ldquo;A picture is a soul; its life on earth
depends upon the body that it inhabits; and we have not
yet found out how to make its body immortal. I do not
believe that my paintings will live more than a few years.
You see, a mural painting is not like your illuminations. You
can keep a book safe in a chest. But a painting on plaster&mdash;or
on a wooden panel&mdash;is besieged day and night by dampness,
and dryness, and dust, and smoke, changes of heat and cold,&mdash;everything.
The wall may crack. The roof may take fire,&mdash;especially
when pigeons and sparrows nest in the beams. The
mere action of the air on any painting must be proved by
years. I got my lesson on that when I was not as old as you.
I heard from an ancient monk of a marvelous Madonna,
painted from a living model&mdash;a beautiful girl pointed out for
years as the Madonna of San Raffaele. I tramped over the
Apennines to see it. Patricio mio, the face was black! The
artist had used oil with resin and wax, and the picture had
turned as black as a Florentine lily! I never told the old
man about it, and I praised the work to his heart&rsquo;s content;
but to myself I said that I would dream no more of my own
immortal fame. I dream only of the work of others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose that a way could be found to make the colors
lasting?&rdquo; queried Padraig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that would be a real Paradise of Painters&mdash;until some
one came along with a torch. I think, myself, that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
day a drying medium will be found which will make it possible
to paint in oils for all time to come. There is painting
on wood, and on dry plaster&mdash;and fresco, where you paint
on the plaster while it is still damp. In fresco you must lay
out only the work that can be finished that day. Me, I am
content for the time to be a fresco painter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if it is all to vanish in a few years, why do we paint?&rdquo;
mused Padraig with a swift melancholy in his voice.</p>

<p>Matteo&rsquo;s hand fell heavily upon his arm. &ldquo;Because we
must not lose our souls&mdash;that is why. The life of our work
will last long enough to be seen and known by others. They
will remember it, and do their work better. Thus it will go
on, generation after generation, until painters come who can
use all that we have learned since Rome fell, and cap it with
new visions. Every generation has its dragon to dispose of.
When I have tamed my dragon he will take me to the skies&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not long after this that Matteo, overhauling the flat
leather-bound coffer in which he kept his belongings, dragged
up from the bottom of the collection some parchments covered
with miscellaneous sketches, mostly of heads and figures.
He had received a message from a sharp-faced Italian peddler-boy
that day, and had been looking rather grave. On the
plaster of the wall, in the sunset light, he began to draw,
roughing it out with quick sure strokes, a procession of men
and horses with some massive wheeled vehicle in the center.
Presently this was seen to be a staging like a van, drawn by
six white oxen harnessed in scarlet. Upon it stood churchmen
in robes of ceremony, grouped about a tall standard rising
high above their heads&mdash;a globe surmounted by a crucifix.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Padraig knew what this was. It was the Carocchio or sacred
car bearing the standard of Milan&mdash;but Matteo was a Florentine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patricio caro,&rdquo; said the artist turning to his young pupil,
&ldquo;to-morrow we shall have to part. I have told the Prince
that you are quite capable of finishing his banquet-hall, and
that I have other business. So I have, but not what he may
think. I had word to-day that Barbarossa has crossed the
Alps. This time it will be a fight to the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, for we have talked often of it, that the League
of the Lombard cities is the great hope of the Communes in
Italy. Moreover, it is your fight as well as ours. If the
Empire conquers it will stamp those Communes flat, and take
good care that the cities make no headway toward further
resistance. The next step&mdash;for Frederick has said that he is
another Charlemagne&mdash;will be the conquest of France, and
then he will try to hurl the whole force of his Empire against
Henry Plantagenet, his only great rival. Myself, I doubt if
he can do that. When men do not want to fight they seldom
win battles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there are three hundred young men of the leading
houses of Lombardy who have sworn to guard the Carocchio
with their lives. The Archbishop and his priests will stand
upon the car in the battle and administer the sacrament to
the dying. If the Emperor takes it this time it will be after
the death of every man of the &lsquo;juramento.&rsquo; I am a Florentine,
that is true, but I shall be a foot-soldier in that fight. If we
live, we will have our cities free. If we die&mdash;it is for our
own cities as well as theirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what I want you to do, little brother. Ah, yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to die is not always the most difficult thing! These are the
names and many of the faces of the &lsquo;juramento.&rsquo; Keep them,
and to-morrow, when I am gone, copy this sketch of the
Carocchio going into the battle. Then, if I never come back,
there will still be some one to paint the picture. When you
find a prince, or some wealthy merchant, who will let you
paint the Carocchio on his wall, do it and keep alive the glory
of Milan. You will find some Milanese who will welcome
you, however the game goes. And the picture will be so good&mdash;your
picture and mine&mdash;that men will see and remember it
whether they know the story or not. If they copy it, although
the faces may not be like, they will yet carry the meaning&mdash;the
standard of the free city above the conflict. Your promise,
Patricio mio&mdash;and then&mdash;addio!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padraig promised. The next day, when he came back
to the little room at the end of the narrow stair, there was
only the picture on the white sunlit wall.</p>

<h2>XXI<br />
<br />
GOLD OF BYZANTIUM<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW GUY OF LIMOGES TAUGHT THE ART OF BYZANTIUM TO
WILFRID OF SUSSEX</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Guy Bouverel</span> was again in his own country,
where he was called, according to the habit of the
day, Guy of Limoges. He had spent nearly ten years
working with Eloy, the master artist, in Limoges,
and studying the art of enameling on copper, silver and gold.
The new name was to him what a degree from some famous
university is to the modern scientist. When a man was called
Guy of Limoges, William of Sens, or Cornelys of Arras, it
usually meant that he was a good example of whatever made
the place mentioned famous. Guy Bouverel might be anybody.
The name was known among the goldsmiths of Guthrum&rsquo;s
Lane in London; that was all. But Guy of Limoges
meant a reputation for enamel-work.</p>

<p>The matter on which he was meditating, however, as he
left Cold Harbor and walked up toward the house of Wilfrid
the potter, was clean outside his own craft. The King,
being much pleased with certain work done at the Abbey for
which Guy was bound, had questioned him about it, and
ended by giving him a rather large order. Brother Basil, a
wise monk from an Irish monastery, had come to England to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
gather artists and artisans, and was for the time at this Abbey
in the north, directing and aiding some work for the Church.
Several of the company that lay the night before at Cold
Harbor were going there, and among them they would be able
to do what the King required.</p>

<p>The dowry of Princess Joan was to include a table of gold
twelve feet long, twenty-four gold cups and as many plates,
and some other trifles. A part of this work would be done in
Limoges; but the King seemed to think that the rest might
be done in England quite as well. He had also ordered stained
glass for a chapel, and some reliquaries, or cases for precious
relics, and three illuminated missals. The Sicilian court was
one of the most splendid in Europe. The King evidently
meant his daughter&rsquo;s setting out to be nowise shabby.</p>

<p>A chest of gold was to be delivered by the Chancellor to
Guy, and he was to accompany it, with its guard, to its destination.
One of the King&rsquo;s accountants would be nominally
in charge, but of course if anything should happen to the
chest, Guy would be in difficulties. There were ingots, or
lumps, of gold, cast in molds for convenience in packing, and
to be used in the goldsmith-work; but the greater part of the
gold was coined bezants&mdash;coins worth about half a sovereign
in modern money, and minted in Byzantium. This would
pay for materials brought from almost every corner of the
known world, and for the work of the skilled metal-worker,
enamel-worker, glassmaker, and lumineur who would fill the
order. Tomaso the physician had established himself in a
half-ruined tower not far from the workshop on the Abbey
lands, and would aid them in working out certain problems;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and altogether, it was such a prospect as any man of Guy&rsquo;s
age and ambition might find agreeable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hola, lad!&rdquo; called Ranulph the troubadour cheerily.
&ldquo;Have you the world on your shoulders, or only some new
undertaking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guy laughed, with a certain sense of relief. He had known
Ranulph for some time, and it occurred to him that here he
might safely find a listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know a certain clerk named Simon Gastard?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not that pleasure,&rdquo; laughed the troubadour. &ldquo;Ought
I to know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you can help it,&rdquo; said Guy, &ldquo;if he is the same
Gastard whom I heard of in France five years ago. Didst
ever hear of sweating gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds like the tale of King Midas,&rdquo; Ranulph chuckled.
&ldquo;How, exactly, does it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not happen,&rdquo; Guy answered, &ldquo;except an itching
palm be in the treasury. There was a clerk in Paris who
took a cask full of gold pieces and sand, which being rolled
about, gold more or less was ground off by the sand without
great change in the look of the coin. Then, the coins being
taken out in a sieve and the sand mixed with water, the gold
dust sank to the bottom and was melted and sold, while the
coins were paid on the nail. I had as lief get money by
paring a cheese, but that&rsquo;s as you look at it. If I have to
travel with this fellow I should like to know that there is
nothing unusual about the chest our gold is in. I cannot
keep awake all the time, and there is enough in that chest
to make a dozen men rich. I knew a rascal once who made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
a hole in the bottom of a chest, stole most of the coin, and
then nailed the chest to the floor to hide its emptiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph laughed sympathetically. &ldquo;You do see the wrong
side of mankind when you have anything to do with treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless you know something of it,&rdquo; returned Guy grimly,
&ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be allowed to handle treasure more than once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; admitted Ranulph. &ldquo;Why not take turns watching
the chest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The others who are bound for the Abbey have gone on.
I had to wait for the Chancellor, and then I saw Gastard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask the potter,&rdquo; said Ranulph at last. &ldquo;He can be trusted,
and he may know of some one who has a chest that will defy
your clerk. I suppose you don&rsquo;t expect him to steal it, chest
and all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I have had dealings with the captain of the guard
before. He is Sir Stephen Giffard, a West-country knight,
and he will send men who can be trusted. The trouble is,
you see, that I am not sure about Gastard. But he could not
object to the secure packing of the gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached Wilfrid&rsquo;s house, and he was
at home. When Guy unfolded his problem the potter looked
thoughtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may have the very thing you want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the way into a small room which he used as a study,
and dragged into the middle of the floor a carved oaken chest
bound with iron. There was just enough carved work on it
to add to its look of strength. Two leopards&rsquo; heads in wrought
iron, with rings in their jaws, formed handles on the ends.
The corners were shielded with rounded iron plates suggesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
oak leaves. The ornamental wrought iron hinges, in an oak
and acorn pattern, stretched more than half way across the
lid and down the back. Iron bolts passing through staples
held the lid, and acorn-headed nails studded it all over. In
fact, the iron was so spread over it in one way and another
that to break it up one would have needed a small saw to
work in and out among the nails, or a stone-crusher. When
the lid was thrown back, more iron appeared, a network of
small rods bedded into the inner surface of lid, bottom and
sides. The staples holding the lock went clean through the
front to the inside of the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a piece of cunning workmanship!&rdquo; said Guy in admiration.
&ldquo;It is like some of the German work, and yet that
never came over seas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Wilfrid, &ldquo;it was done here in the Sussex Weald.
I had the idea of it when I came back from France, and young
Dickon, whom you saw last night, made the iron-work. He
began with the hinges and handles, and then Quentin of
Peronne did the wood-work and brought the chest here, and
Dickon fitted in these grilles yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you sell it?&rdquo; asked Guy. The other hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had meant to keep it to show the Abbey folk,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I had thought it might get Dickon a job at some cathedral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use it to pack some gold-work that&rsquo;s to go to the
King,&rdquo; averred Guy promptly. &ldquo;Will that content you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ought to,&rdquo; smiled Wilfrid, well satisfied, as he took the
contents of the coffer out and shut down the lid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your price?&rdquo; asked Guy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilfrid hesitated again. It might have been thought that
he was wondering how much he could possibly ask. But it
was not that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met you in London, Master Bouverel,&rdquo; he said finally,
&ldquo;and I understood you to be a worker in amail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amail was the common name for enamel. The corruption
may have come from the fancied likeness of the work to the
richly ornamented &ldquo;mail,&rdquo; or from the fact that the enamel
covered the gold as mail covers a man&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amail, gold and silver work, and jewelry,&rdquo; said Guy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it hard to learn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; returned the goldsmith. &ldquo;I was brought
up to the craft, and I&rsquo;ve been at it ten year now in Limoges,
but I&rsquo;m a prentice lad beside the masters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said the potter slowly. &ldquo;I saw amail
in France and Limoges that fair made me silly. I know a
bit of glass-work, and something of my own trade, but this
was beyond me. I&rsquo;ll never be aught but a potter, but if you
can give me a piece o&rsquo; that I&rsquo;ll give you the chest and what
you like besides to make up the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guy smiled&mdash;he had never suspected that Wilfrid felt about
the enameling as he himself did. &ldquo;You shall have it and
welcome,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But why not come to the Abbey
and learn to do the work yourself&mdash;if you can leave your own
workshop? We can do with more men, and there might be
things about the glazing and that which would be useful in
your pottery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilfrid met the suggestion gladly. He could make arrangements
to leave the pottery in the hands of his head man
for a while; for all the work they did was common ware which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
a man could almost make in his sleep. If he could study
some of the secrets of glazing and color work with Guy, he
might come back with ideas worth the journey.</p>

<p>He did not tell Edwitha anything about the enamel-work.
That was to be a surprise.</p>

<p>It was some time before they met again at the Abbey. The
gold arrived safely in due season, and Simon Gastard bade
it good-by, with very sour looks. It was placed in charge
of Brother Basil and Tomaso, and Wilfrid, who had been a
Master Potter, took his place as apprentice to a new craft.
His experience as a potter helped him, however, for the processes
were in some ways rather alike. At last he was ready
to make the gift he intended for Edwitha.</p>

<p>Padraig, the young artist and scribe who was making most
of their designs, drafted a pattern for the work, but Wilfrid
shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is too fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Too many flowers and leaves&mdash;finikin
work. Make it simpler. Every one of those lines
means a separate gold thread. It will be all gold network
and no flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; Padraig answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the man that&rsquo;s to
wear the cap that can say does it fit.&rdquo; And he tried again.</p>

<p>Wilfrid himself modified the design in one or two details,
for he had made pottery long enough to have ideas of his
own. The enamel was to show dewberry blossoms and fruit,
white and red, with green leaves, on a blue ground; the band
of enamel around the gold cup was to be in little oblong sections
divided by strips of ruby red. It was not like anything
else they had made. It was as English as a hawthorn hedge.</p>

<p>Very thin and narrow strips of gold were softened in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
fire until they could be bent, in and out, in a network corresponding
to the outlines of the design. This was fastened
to the groundwork with flour paste. Then it was heated until
the gold soldered itself on. Powdered glass of the red chosen
for the berries was taken up in a tiny spoon made of a quill,
and ladled carefully into each minute compartment, and
packed firmly down. Then it was put into a copper case with
small holes in the top, smooth inside, and rough like a grater
outside, to let out the hot air and keep out hot ashes. The
case had a long handle, and coals were piled all around it
in a wall. When it had been heated long enough to melt
the glass it was taken out and set aside to cool. This took
some hours. When it was cold the glass had melted and
sunk into the compartment as dissolved sugar sinks in a glass.
More glass was put in and packed down, and the process
repeated. When no more could possibly be heaped on the
jewel-like bit of ruby glass inside the tiny gold wall, the
white blossoms, green leaves, blue ground, and strips of
deeper red, were made in turn. Only one color was handled
at a time. If the glass used in the separate layers was not
quite the same shade, it gave a certain depth and changefulness
of color. Overheating, haste or carelessness would ruin
the whole. Only the patient, intent care of a worker who
loved every step of the work would make the right Limoges
enamel. This was one of the simpler processes which are still
known.</p>

<p>The polishing was yet to be done. A goatskin was stretched
smooth on a wooden table; the medallion was fixed in a piece
of wax for a handle, and polished first on a smooth piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
bone and then on the goatskin. Each medallion was polished
in turn until if half the work were wet and half dry the
eye could detect no difference.</p>

<p>Alan brought his mother, Dame Cicely, to the glass-house
while Wilfrid was still at work on the polishing, and after she
had seen the great window they had made for the Abbey
church at the King&rsquo;s order, she paused to look at the enamel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tha&rsquo;lt wear out thy ten finger-bones, lad,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
pleased that my cheeses don&rsquo;t have to be rubbed i&rsquo; that road.
They say that women&rsquo;s work&rsquo;s never done, but good wheaten
bread now&mdash;mix meal and leaven, and salt and water, and
the batch&rsquo;ll rise itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place for a hasty man in the work of making
amail, mother,&rdquo; drawled her son. &ldquo;Nor in most other crafts,
to my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father told me once,&rdquo; quoth Wilfrid, smiling, &ldquo;that
no work is worth the doing for ourselves alone. We were
making a wall round the sheepfold, and I, being but a lad,
wondered at the tugging and bedding of great stones when
half the size would ha&rsquo; served. He wasn&rsquo;t a stout man neither&mdash;it
was the spring before he died. He told me it was &lsquo;for the
honor of the land.&rsquo; I can see it all now&mdash;the silly sheep straying
over the sweet spring turf, gray old Pincher guarding
them, the old Roman wall that we could not ha&rsquo; grubbed up
if we would, and our wall joining it, to last after we were
dead. That bit o&rsquo; wall&rsquo;s been a monument to me all these
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one to scamp work whatever you&rsquo;re at,&rdquo; Guy
declared heartily, &ldquo;but that cup&rsquo;s due to be finished by to-morrow.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>When the wreath of blossoms was in place around the shallow
golden bowl, the smaller garland around the base, and
the stem was encircled with bands of ruby, azure and emerald,
it was a chalice fit for the Queen of Fairyland if she were
also a Sussex lass. Brother Basil, whose eye was never at
fault, pronounced it perfect. It was not like anything else
that they had made, but that, he said, was no matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Abbot Suger of St. Denys made his master-works,&rdquo;
Guy observed as he put away his tools for the night, &ldquo;he did
not bring workmen from Byzantium; he taught Frenchmen to
do their own work. And an Englishman is as good as a
Frenchman any day.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XXII<br />
<br />
COCKATRICE EGGS<br />
<br />
<span class="f70">HOW TOMASO THE PHYSICIAN AND BASIL THE SCRIBE HELD
THE KEYS OF EMPIRE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Brother Basil</span> and Tomaso of Padua sat in the
glass-house crypt, with an oaken chest heavily bound
with iron between them. It had been brought in, and
the ropes about it loosened, by sweating varlets who
looked with awe at the crucibles, retorts, mortars, braziers,
furnaces, beakers and other paraphernalia of what they believed
to be alchemy. They had not agreed about the contents
of that coffer. Samkin held that it was too heavy to
be anything but gold. Hob maintained that if these wise
men could make gold there was no point in sending them a
chest full. Tom Dowgate ended the argument by inquiring
which of them had ever handled gold enough to judge its
weight, and reminding them of the weight of a millstone when
tugged up hill.</p>

<p>It was gold, however. When doors were bolted and windows
shuttered the two philosophers remained silent for a
few moments, Tomaso stroking his white beard, Brother Basil
fingering his rosary. Then the Paduan reached forward and
tilted back the lid. Under a layer of parchment, leather and
tow scraps used for packing, the bezants lay snug and orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
beneath, shining significantly in the light of the bronze lamp.
There was coin enough in that chest to turn the scale, perhaps,
in the next war in Christendom,&mdash;so the Chancellor had said
when he saw it go.</p>

<p>Brother Basil weighed one of the bright new-minted pieces
on his finger-end, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what this bit of metal will do in England,&rdquo; he
mused. &ldquo;Strange&mdash;that a thing so easily destroyed should
have such power over the hearts of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is like a Devil,&rdquo; said the unperturbed physician. &ldquo;He
does not come inside a man&rsquo;s heart unless he is invited. Gold
as you will employ it means the upbuilding of those crafts
that make men&mdash;not serfs. We shall make our treasure instead
of hiring troopers to steal it, if your schools prosper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Basil sighed. &ldquo;I hope so. It is hard to see pages
of priceless wisdom, scribed and illumined by loving and
patient labor, scattered to the winds in the sack of a town.
It made my soul ache to hear the monks of Ireland speak
of the past. I believe that the King means to protect the
Irish Abbeys, but this is a hard age for a peacemaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Plantagenets were never scantly supplied with
brains,&rdquo; observed Tomaso dryly. &ldquo;I think, myself, that the
King will use the sword only to enforce the law, and that
the robber barons are going to have a sad time of it henceforth.
Perhaps Henry is more in tune with the age than you
think. Frederick Barbarossa is coming to grips with the Lombard
cities, and it will be mailed knight against Commune this
time. Meanwhile, let us get to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gold was unpacked and hidden safely in the hollow
of the wall behind the turning stone. When the younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
men arrived the chest was carried up the narrow stair and
refilled with various precious or fragile things which it was
well to have out of the way. The furnaces were set alight and
the working day began.</p>

<p>A fairy spell seemed to possess the fires and the crucibles.
Brother Basil, working at a medallion of enamel, gave a delighted
exclamation as he held up the finished work. The red
roses of Saint Dorothea were like elfin blossoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The saint herself might have come from Alexandria to
help us,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Guy, who never spared trouble, had been finishing a chalice
begun before his recent journey to the south. Even the critical
eye of the Abbot found no flaw in its beauty. The little
group of artists had worked free from the Oriental stiffness
and unreality of their first models. Their designs were conventional,
but the working out was like the quaintly formal
primness of wild flowers in garlands. The traditional shape
might be much the same, but there was a living freshness and
grace, a richness of color and strength of line, which were an
improvement on the model.</p>

<p>Alan, who seldom talked of an idea until he had tried it
out, betook himself to a corner and began doing odd things
with his blowpipe. The others went to work on a reliquary,
and paid no attention to him until their work was well under
way. Then there was a chorus of admiration. The sheet of
glass just ready for the annealing was of the true heavenly
azure that Brother Basil had tried in vain to get.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You kept the rule, I hope?&rdquo; inquired the monk with some
anxiety. &ldquo;We cannot lose that glass now that we have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan shifted from one foot to the other. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
rule,&mdash;that is, not all of it,&rdquo; he answered bluntly. &ldquo;I read a
part on this torn page here, and it seemed to me that I might
work out the rest by this,&rdquo; he showed a chalked formula on
the wall. &ldquo;I tried it, and it came right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tomaso caught up the scrap of parchment. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he
said sharply. &ldquo;Where did this come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a piece that had been used for the packing of the
gold. Parchment was not cheap, and all the bits had been
swept into a basket. Although covered with writing, they
could be scraped clean and used again. The Paduan bent
over the rubbish and picked out fragment after fragment,
comparing them with keen interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No harm is done,&rdquo; he said as he met Alan&rsquo;s troubled gaze,
&ldquo;there may be something else worth keeping here. At any
rate you shall make more blue glass. Keep the formula safe
and secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are days in all men&rsquo;s work which are remembered
while memory endures&mdash;hours when the inspiration of a new
thought is like a song of gladness, and the mind forgets the
drag of past failure. The little group in the Abbey glass-house
and the adjoining rooms where the goldsmiths worked, were
possessed by this mood of delight. The chalice that Guy
had finished, the deep azure glass and the reliquary represented
more real achievement than they had to show for any day in
the past six months. There was just the difference that separates
the perfect from the not quite perfect. Their dreams
were coming true.</p>

<p>The young men walked over the fields to supper at the
Abbey farm, as usual, and Dame Cicely, as usual, stood in the
door to greet them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill20" id="ill20"></a>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How goes the work, lads?&rdquo; she asked, and then caught
Alan by the shoulder, crying, &ldquo;No need to answer. I know
by the face on thee. What hast been doing to make it shine
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only finished a piece o&rsquo; work, mother,&rdquo; said Padraig with
a grin. &ldquo;It takes some men a long time to do that. If they
would bide just this side of a masterpiece they&rsquo;d save &rsquo;emselves
trouble. But they will spend all their force on the last step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Alan, &ldquo;better leap clean over the Strid while
you&rsquo;re about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And for once Padraig had no more to say.</p>

<p>Oddly enough Brother Basil also thought of the Strid that
night&mdash;the deep and dangerous whirlpool in the grim North
Country had haunted him ever since he saw it. He and
Tomaso came back, after dark, to the crypt, and spread out
the torn manuscripts by the light of two flambeaux in the
wall. None of the pages were whole, and the script was in
Latin, Arabic, Greek and Italian, and not all in the same
handwriting. Both believed that in searching the heap for
secrets of their arts they had stumbled on something dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I know where these came from,&rdquo; Tomaso said,
when they had patched together three or four pages. &ldquo;They
are part of the scripts of Archiater of Byzantium, who was
taken for a wizard in Goslar ten years ago. I thought that all
his books were burned. There was talk enough about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are these prescriptions?&rdquo; asked the monk, puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would know by this time,&rdquo; said the Paduan grimly,
&ldquo;if that flame-crested imp of yours, Padraig, had been the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to experiment. By following the directions on this bit of
vellum he might have blown us all into the other world.
Luckily only three of these formulæ are of that nature. The
others are quite safe for your young disciples to play with.
But these we will keep to ourselves.&rdquo; He laid a stained
brownish piece of sheepskin apart from the others and two
smaller ones beside it. &ldquo;These are directions for the manufacture
of aqua regia, Spanish gold, and something which
Archiater called Apples of Sodom. Of a certainty they are
fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, those apples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Basil had lost color. This really was a trifle too
near necromancy to be pleasant. Spanish gold was a Saracen
invention, said to be made of most unholy materials, and
he had heard of a wizard being carried bodily off on the wind
after dealing in the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will carry on our experiments,&rdquo; Tomaso continued,
&ldquo;in the cellars of my tower, if you please. The young ones
will be only too glad to be rid of us. If any one meddled
here we should risk all we have done and the lives of our
pupils. If we make any blunders working by ourselves&mdash;well&mdash;I
sometimes think that I have lived a long time already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The disciples were too well trained to ask any questions,
but they were somewhat mystified by the proceedings which
ensued. An underground chamber straitly walled in with
masonry was fitted up, and the smells that clung to the garments
of Brother Basil when he emerged were more like brimstone
than anything else. Tomaso was never seen at all.
Meanwhile the newly discovered formulæ for glass and enamel
work had been turned over to the workers in the glass-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
with permission to buy whatever material was needed. Padraig
and Guy went to London, and came back with precious
packets of rare gums, dyes, minerals, oils and salts, not to be
found or made at the Abbey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the monk and the physician worked with absorbed
intentness at their crucibles and stills. There was a
slight explosion one evening, and a country lout of the neighborhood
told of it. Next day a neighboring farmer ventured
to ask Padraig what was going on in the ruined tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Padraig soberly, &ldquo;we are raising a brood of
hobgoblins for the King. Did ye not know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The making of sulphuric acid, nitric acid and their compounds
would have been risky business in any age, with the
primitive apparatus that the two investigators had. They
were furthermore made cautious by the fact that they did not
know what might happen if they made the least error. It was
midnight after a long and nerve-racking day when they became
satisfied that they had the secrets of at least three perilous
mixtures in the hollow of their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the King would give seven such chests as the
one he sent, if he knew what we know,&rdquo; said Brother Basil
musingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has the value of that chest already, in the rose window
and the great window, the monstrance, the chalice and the
cups,&rdquo; Tomaso answered, his sense of money values undimmed.
&ldquo;They are as good in their way as Limoges itself can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that we had tidings from London,&rdquo; said the monk
thoughtfully. &ldquo;If Lombardy loses in this war the Emperor
will not stop there. He has said that he will obey no Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
on earth, only Saint Peter and the others in heaven. He is
neither to hold nor to bind, that man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry does not want to fight&mdash;that is certain,&rdquo; said Tomaso.
&ldquo;He desires only to keep for his children what he has
already&mdash;Anjou, Normandy, Aquitaine; and most of all England.
It would take a greater than the Conqueror to rob the
Plantagenets of this kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think will happen in Lombardy?&rdquo; asked the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The League of Lombard cities will fight to the death,&rdquo;
said Tomaso quietly. &ldquo;The Communes are fighting for their
lives, and cornered wolves are fierce. Neither Sicily nor
France is on Frederick&rsquo;s side, although they may be, if he
wins. If he can get Henry the Lion of Saxony to fight under
his banner, it may turn the scale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Henry the Lion married our Henry&rsquo;s daughter Matilda,&rdquo;
said Brother Basil. Tomaso nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without Saxony,&rdquo; the Paduan added, &ldquo;I know that not
more than two thousand men will follow Barbarossa into
Italy, and not more than half are mailed knights. The Lombard
army is more or less light cavalry and infantry. Here
in this cellar we have such weapons as no King has dreamed
of&mdash;blazing leaping serpents, metal-devouring and poison-breathing
spirits, pomegranates full of the seeds of destruction.
These&mdash;in the hands of the Communes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would turn Christendom into the kingdom of Satan,&rdquo;
said Brother Basil as the physician paused. &ldquo;If we were to
give the secret to Henry&rsquo;s clerks, or even if we ourselves
handled the work in London Tower, how long would it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
before treachery or thievery carried it overseas? Are we to
spread ruin over the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would see it as I did,&rdquo; said Tomaso smiling.</p>

<p>The ground vibrated to the tread of hoofs, and a horn
sounded outside the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Ranulph,&rdquo; said Tomaso. &ldquo;I thought he might
come to-night. He will have news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Ranulph came up the path, travel-dusty and weary,
lights twinkled out in the Abbey and the Abbey Farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Emperor has lost,&rdquo; said the troubadour. &ldquo;There
was a battle at Legnano, and the German knights scattered
the Italian cavalry at the first onset, but when they met the
infantry massed about the Carocchio they broke. The Emperor
was wounded and fled. Without Henry of Saxony the
battle was lost before it began. They say that there will be
a treaty at Venice. The Communes have won.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, my son,&rdquo; said Tomaso, turning back into the
tower. &ldquo;We have found an armory of new and deadly weapons.
You have heard of Archiater&rsquo;s apples? We can make
them. Shall we give the Plantagenets to eat of the Tree of
Knowledge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranulph&rsquo;s eyes darkened and narrowed. His quick mind
leaped forward to the consequences of such a revelation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Too much evil ambition lives among
Normans. It might be safe with the King&mdash;and maybe with
Richard, for he loves chivalry and knightly honor&mdash;but John
loves nothing but his own will. Let us have peace in Christendom
while we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we burn the parchment then?&rdquo; asked Brother Basil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay&mdash;keep it in cipher. Let a few trusted men know the
key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will trust our lads,&rdquo; Brother Basil said. &ldquo;Let us ask
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan and Padraig, Wilfrid, Guy, and David, came up
the path. Brother Basil explained the discovery. They had
already heard the news of the Lombard victory from Giovanni,
who had ridden with the troubadour and stopped at the Abbey
Farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with these mysteries?&rdquo; Tomaso asked,
holding out one of the deadly little grenades. &ldquo;You must
remember that some one else may find out the secret without
our help. It is true that the man who did would risk being
burned for a wizard in some places; still, there is little that
men will not dare in the search for knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them find it out then,&rdquo; spoke Padraig in sudden heat.
&ldquo;We have had enough of war in our time. Let us kill this
cockatrice in the egg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These would pay some debts,&rdquo;&mdash;Alan&rsquo;s hard young North-country
face grew stern. He was thinking of tales which
Angelo had told him in his boyhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God can pay debts without money,&rdquo; said Brother Basil
gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not ready,&rdquo; Guy averred. &ldquo;We need time to train
men and to let the land breathe. After that it may be safe
to use the secret&mdash;not now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cat&rsquo;s best in a sack,&rdquo; David commented shrewdly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Padraig is right,&rdquo; said Wilfrid. &ldquo;We have had enough
of war in our time. We will keep this monster prisoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came to an agreement. Padraig was to make copies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
cipher of the formulæ. After ten years, or on his deathbed
should he die within that time, each might give the master-words
and the rules to some comrade who could be trusted.
They were all to swear never to use their knowledge for gain,
or ambition, or vanity, but for the good of their craft, the
glory of God and the honor of the land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we destroy that which we have made,&rdquo; said Brother
Basil, &ldquo;we will show you in part what it can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Metals dissolved like wet salt. Wood and leather were
bitten through as by gnawing rats. A fire was kindled on the
old tower, and a cone-like swarm of giant wasps of fire went
spluttering and boiling up into the darkness. The apples of
Sodom were planted under a troublesome ledge of rock, and
reduced it to rubble.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_284">&ldquo;And there goes what would seat the King of England on
the throne of the Cæsars,&rdquo; quoth Tomaso.</a> The last wavering
flare was dying into the night, and he stood with Ranulph
and Padraig on the top of the tower, under the stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have sat there before, if he had chosen,&rdquo; mused
Ranulph. Padraig was silent. Matteo had fallen beside the
Carocchio, and his heart was sad.</p>

<p>Tomaso laid a hand on Ranulph&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An empire is a forest of slow nurture, beloved of my soul,&rdquo;
he said gently, &ldquo;and it does&mdash;not&mdash;grow&mdash;by&mdash;conflagrations.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
